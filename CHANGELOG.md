This is a user-focused changelog. The entries here are things that affect gameplay.

The dates are when development finished, not when the change was actually deployed to basketball-gm.com or football-gm.com.

Entries in bold are ones important enough that I would have put them in [the old changelog](./CHANGELOG-old.md).

* 2020-05-21: When using historical rosters with pre-scheduled expansion drafts, you now are given the option of taking control of expansion teams. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/goaypl/when_using_historical_rosters_with_prescheduled/)

* 2020-05-20: New hair styles! [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/gnowab/thanks_to_usmileyoaks_there_are_some_new_hair/)

* 2020-05-20: AI teams draft smarter. Previously the probability they would pick a player depended only on that player's rank, but now it depends on how good the players are. So the AI will almost always take the clear #1 pick, but there will be more randomness if the top available prospects have similar talents.

* 2020-05-19: You can now create a "legends" league filled with the best players in each franchise's history. [[1]](https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2020/05/legends-leagues/) [[2]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/gmznsx/new_in_version_202005191391_you_can_now_create_a/)

* 2020-05-14: Historical rosters in BBGM include team abbreviations that change when a team moves, without breaking links to team pages from past seasons. Some parts of the UI still incorrectly display the current abbreviation rather than the historical one.

* 2020-05-14: "Team History" page shows team region and name from past seasons. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/gjy01l/version_202005141399_team_history_page_shows_team/)

* 2020-05-13: "Sim to game" button on the schedule page, which now also includes the All-Star game.

* **2020-05-09: Added real historical rosters back to 1956 in BBGM.

* 2020-05-02: Added tracking of changes to team info (name, region, logo, etc.) so they can be displayed correctly when viewing historical data. Previously, updating a team's name (for example) would update it when viewing data from past seasons too.
