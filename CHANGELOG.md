This is a user-focused changelog. The entries here are things that affect gameplay.

Entries in bold are ones important enough that I would have put them in [the old changelog](./CHANGELOG-old.md).

* 2020-08-17: Added "Finals Appearances" and total winning percentage to the Team History page. [[1]]()

* 2020-08-14: New draft type option in God Mode to eliminate the draft and instead have rookies become free agents. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/i9zhto/version_202008150142_new_draft_type_option_in_god/)

* 2020-08-13: You can watch multiple live games in a single day! Now when you watch a live game, only that one game is simulated. When it's over, the other games from that day will still be waiting to be played. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/i9a6gm/new_in_version_202008131365_you_can_watch/)

* 2020-08-12: New frivolities: Best Teams, Worst Teams, Best Non-Playoff Teams, Worst Playoff Teams, Worst Finals Teams, and Worst Championship Teams.

* 2020-08-10: The contract generation algorithm has been rewritten. It should be both more realistic and harder to take advantage of. Most noticeably, you should no longer see players ask for too much money and go unsigned. [[1]](https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2020/08/smarter-contract-generation/) [[2]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/i5qoj3/new_beta_feature_smarter_contracts_no_more_good/) [[3]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/i77k9w/smarter_contract_generation_is_live_in_version/)

* 2020-08-10: In BBGM, box scores show players who didn't play as DNP (either "Injury" or "Coach's decision") rather than showing a row of all 0s.

* 2020-08-08: Copying the trend in most other basketball sites, the default standings in BBGM are now conference standings, not division standings. FBGM is not changed.

* 2020-08-08: Team records are shown below logos in box scores. And yeah, when you're watching a live game, the records update when the game finishes :) [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/i6792d/in_the_live_game_playbyplay_fouls_show_how_many/)

* 2020-08-08: In BBGM, in the live game play-by-play, fouls show how many free throws will be upcoming. Like "Shooting foul on Dane Wishnowsky, two FTs for Stephen Lees". Additionally, shot attempts appear on their own line before saying if they are made or missed. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/i6792d/in_the_live_game_playbyplay_fouls_show_how_many/)

* 2020-07-27: On the trade page, the trade summary and controls are "sticky" as you scroll so they're always on the screen. This is especially important for FBGM where rosters are huge and much scrolling is required. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/hz68ru/this_is_more_important_for_fbgm_than_bbgm_but_on/) [[2]](https://old.reddit.com/r/Football_GM/comments/hz69o2/on_the_trade_page_the_trade_summary_and_controls/)

[[1]](https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2020/07/game-sim-realism/) [[2]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/hwr0eu/three_improvements_to_game_simulation_realism/)

* 2020-07-16: In FBGM, added the Roster Composition table to the re-signing players screen.

* 2020-07-11: God Mode option to enable/disable ties. So for BBGM ties are now possible, and for FBGM you can turn off ties. Ties only can happen in regular season games, and occur after one overtime period. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/hpn011/god_mode_option_to_enable_ties_version/) [[2]](https://old.reddit.com/r/Football_GM/comments/hpmzz9/god_mode_option_to_disable_ties_version/)

* 2020-07-10: For FBGM, improved AV formula for OL and defensive players, resulting in higher AV for top players at those positions. I also updated the MVP and DPOY formulas to account for this, hopefully retaining good position balance.

* 2020-07-09: A bunch of small FBGM improvements. [[1]](https://football-gm.com/blog/2020/07/recent-development-av-kickers-punters-future/) [[2]](https://old.reddit.com/r/Football_GM/comments/hogban/recent_development_some_small_improvements/)

* 2020-07-08: Tools > Auto Play now lets you specify a phase (playoffs, draft, etc) to sim to, rather than only allowing auto sim to the preseason. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/hnsxf0/tools_auto_play_now_lets_you_specify_a_phase/)

* 2020-07-07: On the Playoffs page, the series score links to the most recent box score from that series.

* 2020-06-27: Random debuts mode now works how you probably wanted it to work in the first place. The pool of players to be randomized is not just current and future players (relative to your starting season), but past players too. So if you start in 2020, you'll get many future draft classes of randomized real players. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/hh71an/random_debuts_mode_now_works_how_you_probably/?)

* 2020-06-27: Menu on the Standings page to switch between League/Conference/Division standings, which is important on mobile where previously only the division standings were visible. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/hgxh7p/menu_on_the_standings_page_to_switch_between/)

* 2020-06-26: +/- buttons for adjusting multiple ratings on the Customize Player page. For BBGM it's all ratings except height. For FBGM it's position-specific and athleticism ratings.

* 2020-06-26: Logos are shown in box scores if the window is big enough.

* 2020-06-26: Support for exporting/importing individual players or groups of players, at Tools > Import/Export Players. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/hgakyd/import_and_export_individual_players_from_leagues/)

* 2020-06-19: Added an "Export draft class" button to the Draft History page so you can export and re-use historical draft classes.

* 2020-06-18: Awards, All-Star selections, and league leaders are now determined based on total season stats for traded players, rather than just stats from their latest team. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/hbqod0/awards_allstar_selections_and_league_leaders_are/)

* **2020-06-13: A bunch of new options for league creation: challenge modes (no draft picks, no free agents, no trades, no visible ratings), player development realism, and more. [[1]](https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2020/06/league-creation-options/) [[2]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/h8dq90/a_bunch_of_new_options_for_league_creation/) [[3]](https://old.reddit.com/r/Football_GM/comments/h8dr1y/a_bunch_of_new_options_for_league_creation/)**

* 2020-06-08: Sortable table rows (roster, fantasy draft, football depth chart) can be reordered by clicking two rows to swap them, in addition to dragging like normal. This is sometimes easier on mobile.

* **2020-06-07: Added the News Feed page, available in the League menu. This incorporates a score for each event that happens, allowing you to filter events by importance. This replaces the old Transactions and Event Log pages. [[1]](https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2020/06/news-feed/) [[2]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/gyc615/news_feed_changes_are_live_in_version_202006070785/)**

* 2020-06-03: If you use God Mode to retire a player, it checks for Hall of Fame eligibility and notifies you if he makes it. And when you edit a player's contract, it also updates the "Salaries" table on player pages and the "Career Earnings" frivolity. [[1]](https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2020/06/real-rosters-back-to-1947-contraction/) [[2]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/gvtw5o/new_features_in_version_202006030801_real_rosters/)

* 2020-05-22: Button on the Create/Edit Player page to randomize player ratings, which works by generating a random player of the same age and copying his ratings over. In FBGM it also matches by position.

* 2020-05-20: AI teams draft smarter. Previously the probability they would pick a player depended only on that player's rank, but now it depends on how good the players are. So the AI will almost always take the clear #1 pick, but there will be more randomness if the top available prospects have similar talents.

* 2020-05-19: You can now create a "legends" league filled with the best players in each franchise's history. [[1]](https://basketball-gm.com/blog/2020/05/legends-leagues/) [[2]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/gmznsx/new_in_version_202005191391_you_can_now_create_a/)

* 2020-05-14: Historical rosters in BBGM include team abbreviations that change when a team moves, without breaking links to team pages from past seasons. Some parts of the UI still incorrectly display the current abbreviation rather than the historical one.

* 2020-05-14: "Team History" page shows team region and name from past seasons. [[1]](https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/gjy01l/version_202005141399_team_history_page_shows_team/)

* 2020-05-13: "Sim to game" button on the schedule page, which now also includes the All-Star game.

* 2020-05-10: Schedules for leagues with non-standard teams and divisions now have balanced home/away games when possible. Or at least close to that - it's not a deterministic algorithm, but it works pretty well.

* **2020-05-09: Added real historical rosters back to 1956 in BBGM.

* 2020-05-02: Added the ability to change what division/conference a team belongs to from Tools > Manage Teams.

* 2020-05-02: Added tracking of changes to team info (name, region, logo, etc.) so they can be displayed correctly when viewing historical data. Previously, updating a team's name (for example) would update it when viewing data from past seasons too.

* 2020-05-01: Added "Acquired" column to the re-signing players table.
