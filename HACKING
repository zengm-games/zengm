Plea for help
-------------

Do you like this game? Or, do you at least like the idea of what this game
could one day be? Then PLEASE HELP US! We need people with all kinds of skill
sets to work on (and this is not an exhaustive list):

* Artwork
* UI design and implementation
* Database optimization
* Game simulation
* Opposing manager AI
* Localization
* New gameplay features
* Packaging
* Windows/Mac testing and bugfixing

So please, get the code on GitHub <https://github.com/jdscheff/basketball-gm>
and start hacking. Or email me <jdscheff@gmail.com> and we can discuss how you
want to contribute.


Coding style
------------

http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ with the following exceptions:

* Use a maximum line length of 120 in Python files. (NOTE: The current code
  doesn't always obey this rule, but it will be updated.)

* Use Google-style comments, because I like them better

Directory structure
-------------------

This describes an *ideal*, not what things actually are in practice. For
instance, a lot of stuff in ./bbgm/views should be elsewhere within ./bbgm.
Slowly, this will be corrected. But try to stick to these guidelines for new
stuff, at least.

./bbgm
    Main Python module.

./bbgm/core
    Game logic. No UI code.

./bbgm/views
    UI code. No game logic. (Currently, there is tons of game logic here,
    especially in main_window.py. There shouldn't be.)

./bbgm/util
    Convenience functions, glue functions, and stuff that doesn't fit elsewhere.

./bin
    Contains the main executable that launches the game.

./data
    Any data files, including database schema.

./tests
    Tests (Currently, basically nothing is here.)

./ui
    Any UI files: GtkBuilder files, images, etc.
