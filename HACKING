Plea for help
-------------

Do you like this game? Or, do you at least like the idea of what this game
could one day be? Then PLEASE HELP US! We need people with all kinds of skill
sets to work on (and this is not an exhaustive list):

* Artwork
* UI design and implementation
* Database optimization
* Game simulation
* Opposing manager AI
* Localization
* New gameplay features

So please, get the code on GitHub <https://github.com/jdscheff/basketball-gm>
and start hacking. Or email me <jdscheff@gmail.com> and we can discuss how you
want to contribute.


Coding style
------------

http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ with the following exceptions:

* Don't worry too much about line length, for now.

* Use Google-style comments, because I like them better

Basketball stuff
----------------

Abbreviations of stats should be done like basketball-reference.com stat pages.
For instance, "defensive rebounds" is "drb". This might not be currently done
consistently everywhere, but it should be in the future. This command is useful
for renaming things (although USE WITH CARE!):

    grep -rl --include={*.py,*.html,*.sql,game_sim.js} '' . | xargs sed -i 's/old/new/g'
