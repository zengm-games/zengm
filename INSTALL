Basketball GM should work pretty much anywhere PyGTK runs. For now, this file
includes instructions for Linux and Windows.


Linux
=====

Dependencies
------------

Required:

* PyGTK
* SQLite

Optional packages (speeds up gameplay by about 10%):

* Numpy

To install all these packages in Ubuntu 11.04, run:

    sudo apt-get install python-gtk2 libsqlite3-0 python-numpy

To install all these packages in Fedora 15, run as root:

    yum install pygtk2 sqlite numpy


Running and/or installing
-------------------------

To run the game from this directory:

    ./bin/basketball-gm

Or, to install the game system-wide and then run it:

    sudo python setup.py install

    basketball-gm

The system-wide install through setup.py should also make a launcher for "Basketball GM".

This should work pretty much anywhere PyGTK runs. For now, this file includes
instructions for Linux and Windows.


Windows
=======

WARNING: THERE ARE BUGS HERE! For instance, loading and saving games doesn't
seem to work. But the rest of the game runs beautifully!


Dependencies
------------

At a minimum, you need Python, PyGTK, and pysqlite set up. As of July 2011, the
latest Windows installers of these three packages can be found here:

Python 2.7 installer:http://www.python.org/getit/
PyGTK 2.22 all-in-one installer:
    http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/pygtk/2.22/
pysqlite 2.6 installer: http://code.google.com/p/pysqlite/downloads/list


Running and/or installing
-------------------------

The installer currently doesn't work on Windows, but you can run it without
installing. Open up a command prompt, navigate to this directory, and run
something like (depending on your Python installation):

    C:\Python27\python.exe bin\basketball-gm
