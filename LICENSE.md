Copyright (C) Jeremy Scheff. All rights reserved.

**This project is not open source!** But it's not completely closed either.
It's somewhere in between. My goal here is to make my code as publicly available
as possible without letting people distribute playable forked versions of the
game that compete with <https://basketball-gm.com/> or
<https://football-gm.com/>.

In order to receive this license, you must agree to its rules. The rules of this
license are both obligations under that agreement and conditions to your
license. You must not do anything with this software that triggers a rule that you
cannot or will not follow.

You must ensure that everyone who gets a copy of any part of this software from
you, with or without changes, also gets the text of this license.

# Things you are allowed to do with the source code

(This is an exhaustive list! These 4 things are literally all you are allowed to
do with the code. Nothing else is allowed.)

- **View it.** No restrictions.

- **Edit it.** You are allowed to edit the source code, but see below for
  restrictions on running and sharing it.

- **Run it locally.** You can run a private copy locally. This may only be
  accessed by you, not by any other people.

- **Share it.** You can share the source code, either in its original form
  or including modifications you made under the terms of this license.

# Things you are not allowed to do with the source code.

(This is *not* an exhaustive list! These are simply examples of things that you
cannot do, based on the previous exhaustive list of things you are allowed to
do.)

- **Host a version of the software that others can access.**
  <https://basketball-gm.com/> and <https://football-gm.com/> are the only
  publicly available version of the software that can be easily used. If you
  want to make changes to the software that other people can use, contribute
  them back to the project so they can go live on <https://basketball-gm.com/>
  and <https://football-gm.com/>.

- **Make any kind of redistributable installer.** For example, you can't wrap a
  version of the software in something like Phonegap to let people easily
  install it on their mobile devices. You can't put it in some downloadable
  Windows installer. You can't do anything to distribute the software to end
  users. Only I can do that stuff. You can only share the source code and the
  instructions in README.md for running it.

- **Do some trivial bullshit to get around the previous restrictions.** I'm not
  a lawyer so maybe there is some loophole. Don't use it. Please don't make me
  regret sharing my code.

- Let me reiterate one more time: **you can't in any way deploy the software for
  public use or compete with <https://basketball-gm.com/> or
  <https://football-gm.com/>**.

# No Liability

As far as the law allows, this software comes as is, without any warranty or
