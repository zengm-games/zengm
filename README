Don't send me any bug reports right now because I know there are plenty of bugs
and plenty of features that need to be added.  However, if you are a Python
hacker who wants to work on the game, please email me.  There is a lot of work
left to be done to make this game more fun, and I can't do it all myself.

Dependencies
------------

Required packages on Ubuntu 11.04 (probably similar on other distros):

* libsqlite3-0
* python >= 2.5
* python-egenix-mxdatetime
* python-gtk2
* python-numpy

To install all these, run:

sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-0 python-egenix-mxdatetime python-gtk2 python-numpy

I haven't tried any other platforms, but if you install the packages listed
above on Windows, maybe it would work.


Use
---

To run the game, just execute:
./bin/basketball-gm
