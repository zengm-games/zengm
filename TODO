main todo
- new season
  - add row to team stats
  - add row to player stats if they're on a team
  - update ratings for all non-retired players
- free agents
  - don't add new row to stats if it's the offseason, but do during the season. Same for drafted players, only add stats row when they're put on a roster
- resigning old players
  - negotiationList
- make sure all the existing views work with multiple seasons, as they used to
- other views
- reassess how money is stored (ones, thousands, millions?)
strategic issues
- is localStorage fast enough for game_attributes, and possibly other stuff, like trades and contract negotiation?
- refactor and make sure i'm doing things correct as far as modules, namespaces, documentation, style, etc.
  - What will replace the AJAX calls? Just call api.whatever function directly and have it do the jQuery crap
- speed things up by combining transactions

---

How should I handle in-league database? One big transaction?

---

BUGS

ratings should all be integers before being saved
playoff teams aren't being set in exactly the right order

---

PORTING NOTES:

team_attributes.playoffs is now team.made_playoffs
template loop count - how?
- conf rankings in standings
- class="separator"
  - box score (top 5)
  - standings (top 8)
startingSeason should be stored so later years can have different values
at some point, go through the indexeddb code. factor out common patterns into a library. combine transactions where appropriate
make sure all indexes are actually used. otherwise they're just making it slower for nothing

---

POLISH FEATURES

is dbm necessary?
- teamStore replaced by helpers.getTeams
- leagueStore replaced by localstorage of GameAttributes

roster view
- past season: go based on players.stats.tid
- auto sort button
- make sure teams dropdown works
- trade for button
- release button
- buy out button
- row handle is too skinny - why?
draft
- draft history view
contract negotiation
- test all the error conditions and make sure callbacks are appropriately called (unit tests?)
- add free agent to the end of roster

test deep index stats.tid, stats.season: {pid, stats: {tid, season, pts, reb, ...}}

League schema: teamStats and playerStats refer to totals that will be divided by numGames to get averages

players = {playerAttributes, ratings: {playerRatings}, stats: {season, playoffs=Bool, numGames, playerStats}}
Index: *pid, tid, ratings.season, stats.tid, stats.season, stats.playoffs

teams = {teamAttributes, numGames, stats: {playoffs=Bool, teamStats}}
Index: tid, cid, did, season, stats.playoffs

games =  {gid, season, teamStatsForIndividualGame, playerStatsForIndividualGam}
Index: *gid, tid, season
- can tid be an array so that gid can be unique? can i index on an array?

playoffSeries = {season, currentRound, series: [[{}, ...], ...]}
- first row is for round, second row is for series, just like the series object in views.playoffs

schedule = {schedule}

conferences, divisions = simple global data structures

Querying based on multiple indexes: https://github.com/philikon/queryIndexedDB
Try that first, as it looks simple. If it doesn't work, try: http://linq2indexeddb.codeplex.com/ http://www.kristofdegrave.be/2012/05/using-linq-to-indexed-db.html
CAN EITHER OF THESE HANDLE JOINS? Intersection and Union in the first, what about second?

var teamStore = dbm.transaction("teams").objectStore("teams");
request = Index('did').eq(2).getAll(teamStore)
request.onsuccess = function (event) {
    console.log(request.result);
}

var dbConfig = {};
dbConfig.version = 1;
var db = window.linq2indexedDB("meta", dbConfig, true);
db.linq.from("leagues").select().then(function(data){
	console.log("Selected " + data.length + " items");
	console.log(data);
});
