OVERALL ROADMAP:
multiple seasons
- at the end of every season, archive the player stats (player_career_stats?) and delete box scores
add variability to the similuation.  every year shouldn't be the same, even with identical input
add more players/teams to the database
add all (or placeholder) players/teams to the database
scheduling
salaries, free agents, trades
aging
draft
playoffs

SOME TIME:
improve game simulation code
use a new thread for game simulation: http://aruiz.typepad.com/siliconisland/2006/04/threads_on_pygt.html
    look at conduit code for inspiration, particularly the DB stuff - Database.py and http://svn.gnome.org/viewvc/conduit/trunk/tools/test-db-wrapper/main.py?view=markup
