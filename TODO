UI for selecting a custom set of teams in a new league
- "Customize" link in "Pick your team", maybe next to "Random". that results in a list of custom teams+options in state, which is reset whenever you switch the season/phase for real players, or switch the customize setting on the right
  - does this make sense? what if we do a real players league and pick 2 custom teams with random players, what would that imply?
    - i guess that's fine... real players would be generated from the team configuration, and if there are none, there are none. all other settings from that real season would still apply
- clicking "Customize" takes you to a new page
  - list of teams by confs/divs
    - allow CRUD of confs/divs/teams
    - allow drag and drop to reorder confs/divs
      - https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd
    - allow drag and drop to move teams to other divs
  - add/edit team
    - region name, pop, stadium capacity, logo URL, srID (dropdown, not free text, and help popover explaining that real team overrides will apply), colors, include real players?, append real players season to last name?
  - while viewing confs/divs/teams, buttons on the side
    - Presets
      - Default BBGM teams with random players
      - Real teams and players
        - shows a popup to let you pick a season and select if you want to include players or not
      - Legends
        - shows a popup to let you pick a decade
  - Save/Cancel buttons at the bottom
- for real players leagues, make sure scheduled events are correct (delete any referring to teams that aren't there, and make sure tids are correct especially for expansion teams)

File System Access API https://web.dev/file-system-access/
- use (when available) for saving any files
- is it possible to stream from IDB to file?
  - write to stream returns a promise
  - transaction auto commit still unavoidable? if so:
    - could we just keep writing to file without awaiting?
    - use multiple transactions, one for each "chunk"
  - Send a Tweet to @ChromiumDev with #filesystemaccess and let us know where and how you're using it.
- is it possible to select a directory, and auto save there every year?
  - Since permissions currently are not persisted between sessions, you should verify whether the user has granted permission to the file using queryPermission(). If they haven't, use requestPermission() to (re-)request it.

ability to switch back to prior year
- In danger zone, button to reset to preseason of any season
  - preseason, or regular season? or pick phase?
- On export league, ability to export at any past preseason
- would need to store rosters each preseason, similar to groundhog day
  - new object store, primary key season, array of all roster infos?
    - do i ever want to suppport different phases? then primary key needs to be (season, phase)
    - delete old data
    - league export
    - league creation
  - write at the end of newPhase that switches to this season+phase?
- available seasons/phases populate the menu by looking at the keys of the object store
- also roll back teams, somehow
- roll back g changes, when possible
  - maybe store g in the object store too... { g, teams }
- g.repeatSeason could become a boolean that uses this (eventually, gotta worry about upgrades)
- maybe not...
  - in other games, this would be achieved by saving at different times. when that is easier (stream) that will be better
  - storing g is messy, since g already has a history mechanism

name/colleges revamp
- races
  - @ClevelandFan#6181 can help ~/Downloads/BBGM_Countries.csv
  - playerBioInfo.countries[].races?: Record<Race, number>,
  - defaultRaces: Record<Country, Record<Race, number>>
  - CSV in tools, generate JSON like names, print countries missing
    - incorporate group info from defaultCountries.groups, or just import defaultCountries after generating names json
  - default values for individual countries
  - new release of faces.js, and upgrade
- global default... should it override individual countries?
  - distinction between "default if unset in built-in defaults" and "override built-in defaults too". add some other property like defaultAll that overrides everything, with same format as default
- flag icon on roster page

When drafting expansion team, the new draft picks are crazy “unhappy with the teams performance”. Like, that’s a -29 to the score. I know that by next re-signings it only factors the current season, but it’s annoying to have it there regardless. How can he be upset at performance if there is none :sob: https://discord.com/channels/290013534023057409/290015591216054273/784773126138757122

nicidob new ovr formula
- basketball: https://github.com/dumbmatter/gm-games/pull/275/files
- football: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/H5pPmb3r6J/
  - nicodob says:
    - as I said I rewrote this code (b/c I'm doing the testing on a different computer) and the PR uses .csv exports but this version uses .json leagues. https://github.com/nicidob/fbgm/blob/master/ratings.ipynb
    - that does the ratings and vomits out the over_under roster
    - as-is it basically eats FBGM or BBGM leagues up. It does the position-specific code. So to replicate the PR I just replace the pos = r['pos'] with pos='ALL' and the code is happy to do it
    - yeah I mean there's a handful of differences here. this uses JSON leagues (not a split 'avg.csv'/'game.csv'), and does position-specific breakdowns. But yes it's the same thing, it takes leagues with box scores and does minute-weighted rating differences to MOV for individual games
    - it also doesn't do the scaling to ensure the mean and variance are unchanged (i just check R^2 and move on)
    - And here I'm using L1 Regularization + Cross-Validation to drop a bunch of coefficients to zero for ratings that don't matter
    - the problem is i got really wonky distributions when I tried to output the FBGM stuff
    - like I don't understand how mean/variance are set by the code right now
    - the notebook spits out a copy+paste table for ovr.football.ts and I have a local copy with it but the numbers are big and positions are set - wrong because I deleted bonuses and.....
    - it was non-obvious to me how to get these in-game in a good way so I don't have a good PR

FBGM too many very short players

on trade summary page, also show how the player left the team (or if still active/retired). use p.transactions

Maybe another frivolty to say which players were the best with a certain pick, e.g. 1-3 would be Michael Jordan IRL, 1-1 would be LeBron James, etc @lewie100

for shot type distributions, base it on real player ratings (model ratings -> shot distribution) "y= softmax(Wx) with x being ratings and y being the shot distribution." @nicidob
- even more fun... you can implement ideas like "midrange is the leftover shot" if you fix the logit value for the mid-range to a constant and just learn parameters for the other shots.
- last perk: you can do this independently for every single year (or batch the years) and either use those parameters raw or smooth them and get more fun historical curves that aren't just "3p tendency"

trade summary charts future
- some indication for winning a championship, special marker?
  - tooltip required, for clarity
- tooltip
  - team region, name, record, playoff result
- https://github.com/airbnb/visx
  - would it make tooltips easier?

fuzz
- nicidob - fix fuzz uniformity so that it's more like 70 +/- 1, 60 +/- 3,  50 +/-5

show ovr when live editing a player's ratings
- use worker, don't include code in both

more variation in pace plz @nicidob

how to stop 2p from beign a negative rating
- @nicidob says: basic summary: it's used only in "usage", but it's a small part of that, and "shoot midrange". Well... shoot midrange is like 0.8 to 0.9 PPS, while Dunks and 3s are 1.2 and 1.1 PPS. Sure, actual ratings shift the %s, but i'm not sure how extreme it'd have to get before your MR PPS isn't the "worst possible shot". So the 2p setting basically is "how likely are you to take the worst possible shot". My idea is to make the mid-range more of a "leftover"... if your 3p or dunk or LP isn't high enough, it gets picked. then higher 2p is just higher MR accuracy and its negative effect is gone. Then you can era-adjust the default

break difficulty setting into multiple components that can be controlled independently

Click on the phase by play button to quickly take you to relevant page. So clicking on playoffs takes you to playoffs, draft to draft, FA to FA. So on. Reg and preseason to dashboard @dooby moogey#2784

settings re-design
- all settings should be editable when creating a new league
  - ...including God Mode settings, like "# Players On Court" which alter the number of players in a league
  - also new league has some extra settings that don't persist, like randomization and no starting injuries
  - ui... below form? separate page? part of flow (like optional 2nd page before league creation)?
  - make sure it handles setting the season for pace etc in real players leagues
  - godModeRequired value of "existingLeagueOnly" should be used here
  - https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/jltrgv/monthly_suggestions_thread/gd4kwuf/
- some settings should only be editable in offseason
  - playoff structure

real player rosters doesn't exactly have the +8 mood boost for rookies working because of NBA length deals.
- add marker for rookie contracts
- also use this to determine who can be released, rather than the hacky way now

option to disable the cap entirely. Turn the Hard Cap option into "Cap Type" with "None, Soft Cap, Hard Cap". leave the setting for actual salary cap, so it can be used for all the contract computation. @nicidob

- could value DPs and players before first progs more
- I don’t think it’s something intended to happen, pretty frequently if I trading block a late first round pick I get offers for guys drafted ahead of my pick
- care more about bad contracts

- instead of region and name, it's short name and long name
- abstract any display of team name/region to handle this
  - maybe in teamsPlus, have longName and shortName which check some option to see how to generate them
- @Ra98

profit for extreme caps needs to be fixed first, its not possible to make money above $400m cap space

during re-signing phase, should still show % everywhere except re-signing table. same with free agency, i think?

AI re-signing is just player mood + trade function
- later
  - have it affect free agent signings too

  - add player stats if phase after regular season
    - advanced stats will require team stats too... sum up from players?
    - advanced stats and other missing values, calculate on load?
  - what about changes to settings (like playoff settings, etc), does it need to store previous season's value too?
  - what about seasons with expansion teams?
    - tricky for draft, since it should have expansion draft as already happened... maybe disable those years
      - could get results of expansion draft and assing those players to team!

built-in UI to load custom user files
- UI in BBGM to create league
  - api to list league files
  - page in BBGM to list the league files, with links that go to the new league form pre-populated with that URL for a league file

  - gwood
- database table to store metadata
  - id

  - num_leagues_created
  - last_updated
  - version (increment every update, keep in URL)
- CRUD UI for people to upload/edit/delete league files

gradually reveal progs mode
- displayed ratings are f(t, current ratings, last year's ratings)
  - after like half the season, always just current ratings. prior to that, depends on phase and games played
  - reveal with some polynomial, like x^n, so it's not predictable if a small increase will lead to a big increase later

DataTable
- places to use sortValue (implemented) and searchValue (not implemented yet):
  - ImportPlayers inputs
  - Height/Weight in PlayerBios needs searchValue
  - NegotiateButtons (search for negotiate/refuses)
  - sorting by skills on draft history
  - would allow sorting by checked/unchecked for trade and trading block
  - get rid of awkward children stuff - PlayerNameLabels, mood, ...

in GM DL/LB/S are kinda the same. In real life, they're usually humans of different sizes
- 40 times tell the defensive positions apart: 4.5 for CB, 4.7 for LB, 4.8 for DE
- shuttle times tell DE/DT from LB
- S should be closer to CB than LB, and there should be less jumping around from genRatings.football
- player generator should be more rigid, based on input position. especially for offense/defense, like CBs who are decent RBs
  - could throw out ones who slide over to other position
  - or add less randomness
  - or change ovr formula
- "a decent chunk of DBs in real life produce stats that FBGM never generates"
  - needs more positive outliers

import/export players

- eventually add/edit/delete individual events
  - needs to handle tids, like already happens for adding/removing teams
  - warn about breakage, like a team changing divisions if division expansion doesn't happen
  - delete, or just disable?
    - if delete expansion, need to delete future events for that tid and adjust other tids
    - when deleting individual expansion draft, make sure to account for the fact that you could have a team that was created in a prior expansion draft, so its tid might still exist (and not require adjusting of future teams)
  - add - check for dupe one already existing (by season+type and maybe tid)
  - edit
    - game attributes - share code with god mode settings
    - open modal on click "edit", or inline form

more realistic free agents when generating league
- look at retired young players from previous season

customizable columns in datatable
- future
  - SortableTable
  - supercols
    - change input format to be associated with these index numbers, then can derive which should be shown and where
    - or, change cols input to include flag for which supercol a col belongs to
    - but for MVP, no customization of supercols tables
  - always return all stats and ratings?

add average team age to power rankings @TheRealGWood#4891 
- save to teamSeason at end of season, along with ovr and any other things on power rankings page
- for current season, compute dynamically

- people really like looking back at history
- people really want better playing time control
- player comparison should be better
  - https://bbgm6man.eiphi.eu/

- better international name options
- player mood revamp (bigger contract, ring-chasing, etc)

@Sniksir#7396 A button to completely clear either side of the trade window would save a ton of time.

    - if version in cloud is greater than googleFileVersion, show button to overwrite league with latest from cloud
    - if both of those things are true, show warning

    - show button to upload to cloud
  - some way to import leagues from the cloud (maybe another "New League" button, and support "Import" over existing one too)
  - some way to delete things from cloud
    - deleting a league locally should pop up an option of if you want to delete from cloud
  - design
    - condense some columns (name, team, difficulty) into one
    - add column for # seasons played
- Data stored locally
  - in each league, store google file ID, version, and timestamp of last sync (download or upload) w/ cloud
    - googleFileID
    - googleFileVerison
    - googleLastSync
- API
  - should this run all client side, or do we need a server side component?
    - try all client side first
  - authentication
    - https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/js
    - store all keys and gapi object in worker
  - get list of cloud saves, including google file ID, BBGM league ID, last time played, and last phase/season
    - how to search for them? https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/properties says it is possible

  - download existing save by google file ID
  - upload new save
  - update (overwrite) existing save
  - delete save
- for multiplayer leagues, some way to support other people having read access to a league
  - manual input of file ID or URL
- store on my system (s3 maybe) or use google drive?
  - google drive
    - https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/reference/files could put metadata in "properties"
      - use that to store some unique ID of the save
    - UI integration https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/about-apps
    - thumbnail https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/create-file#upload_thumbnails
    - challenge - how do i stream data out of IndexedDB and into Google Drive?
      - ideally would send data from IndexedDB to WritableStream to some HTTP API, but that doesn't seem supported - https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/378 for the HTTP request, but also it's a problem with IDB auto closing transactions
      - so would need to read entire league file into memory first

god mode stuff
- more stuff on player editor
- awards editor
- pick all stars, and captains
- edit list of injuries, deaths

add option to disable salary cap @hrmantovani#2284 
- historical leagues
- merge with hard cap setting
- salary cap value is still inflation

FBGM
- retirement age
  - increase roster size limit to 55
- when the ball is turned over, instead of a new set of downs, you start where the other team left off
- Some automatic first down penalties result in 1st and 1
- in FBGM, tags aren't generated for custom roster's draft classes until the end of the season.
- rosters https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicidob/bbgm/master/fbgm_roster_2019_sss.json
- kneeling at end of games
- some OL stat
- increase value of K/P so they won't be traded for nothing
  - user report of K/P being released by AI teams during season! AI teams should take roster construction into account here
  - @geonerd#6946
- smarter cutting when over roster limit (like don't cut only K/P)
- easier position changes, maybe from roster or player pages
  - auto sort roster after? or maybe have option to set if user controls roster sort or not
    - default should be "not"
- Add the release and trade away buttons to the depth chart screen. I find myself flipping back and forth from the depth chart and roster.
- Add the roster composition to any roster type screen like draft, depth chart, and trade screens.
- trade possible after playoffs phase begins, but only before first playoff game is played?
- weird offensive holding application https://old.reddit.com/r/Football_GM/comments/i33wix/penalties_wonky/g1073zl/?context=3
- DL in FBGM get way too many interceptions, CB should get more
- in FBGM, during the FA period with 30 days: injured players on rosters will not recover a single week if you sim to 1 day left in FA; injured players in fa will recover a week in every day of FA (30 weeks total)
- in OT, if the other team has already scored a FG, never punt!!!
- better support for running QBs to put up big numbers
- penalties accepted when normal gain would have been better

- had a playoff game go to double overtime. with two minutes left in the first OT, I saw a score pop up on the scoring summary saying someone had kicked a field goal. that did not actually happen in-game. instead, the game went to the second overtime, where that field goal did in fact happen with two minutes to play. so basically, in double overtime games, the scoring summary updates scores for the second overtime at the times they happened, but in the first OT instead. first OT (field goal was not kicked, but the scoring summary updated anyways)

eventually
- what happens to scheduled event if the user changes something relevant to it prior to the event happening? does this matter?
- show draft prospects separately when creating a new custom league, to allow creating one without them

manually specify draft order in god mode
- make draft page drag-and-drop, with purple handles
- dropdown to force lottery winners
  - would need to deal with coin flips for ties not making the top N reliable

add logos to league history table?

option to have numeric game attributes (salary cap, shooting tendencies) increase by a constant amount of a multiple
- check if upcoming scheduled event and noop if there is one

redo trade system
- make it so that teams are less likely to trade for players when there is a better/ slightly worse player in FA for around the same price. people exploit that all the time
- some factor based on # of recent trades (similar to player mood revamp?)
- value of picks should depend of draftType setting

team needs/synergy display on roster
- and power rankings

---

BAA teams should enter with intact rosters, not expansion draft

way to bulk delete leagues
- replace "delete all leagues". show checkmarks next to leagues, including "check all" button and a delete button

handle abbrevs changing over time without breaking URLs by appending _tid to abbrev in URL
- any abbrev returned in stats or ratings from playersPlus is wrong
  -  see tidAndSeasonToAbbrev in most.ts for how to do it right
- using team*Cache from UI is probably wrong too

in leagues with no 3 pointers, 3 pointers should not be tracked
- shot locations?

relocation fun stuff
- would be cool to let people cancel a relocation of their team
  - could prompt them, and then if they say no still move their cid/did but leave the rest alone
- would be cool to let people move their team (and rebrand) by spending $

ovr formula should change depending on game simulation settings, especially 3 point shooting

what would it really cost to store all game sim results?

- have it decrease as a player plays. so high only for draft prospects or unknowns

add copy league function
- https://old.reddit.com/message/messages/nmnr87

better trade finder AI
- handle salary matching constraint
- use in trading block, and betweenAiTeams
- after doing this
  - make sure big trades happen enough in betweenAiTeams - see random.choice weights in betweenAiTeams
  - also make sure betweenAiTeams doens't accept really bad trades, see dv2 check
    - especially for minor trades, not sure if dv as an absolute value rather than % makes sense

global key info (salary, days until playoffs, team  etc)

redesign dashboard
- include some historical context
- top FAs
- award races
- injuries
- draft picks owned, and rank of team
- top draft prospects

events revamp
- eventually
  - nothing should be lost, ever
  - store info about trade, so the summary of a trade can be linked to
    - for traded picks, store info so eventual picked players can be filled in later
  - like trade above... all events should not have premade text, but instead have the metadata to generate it. then can do things like including RatingsStatsPopover
  - in playoffs, recovery should only be notable if the team is still alive
  - include all time records being broken, like career scoring, etc
  - merge some together
    - expansion draft teams in one event
    - contraction teams in one event

support changing team logos at any season, from predefined real team logos
- future
  - handle if the user edits something but realTeamInfo specifies an override
    - could check if the pre-overridden value is the previous override or not
    - could add a flag to track if a field has been edited or not
    - neiether of those is perfect
  - make player photo overrides dynamic too?

game sim improvements

- ask what kind of players are not common enough

gm history page
- like team history, but for the teams you GMed
- allow switching after season without getting fired

  - more info, not just games
    - progress bar showing phases, completion of season
    - mobile: only show either games or other info, with toggle between them

login issues
- DefinitelyNotDonaldTrump on discord can help debug
  - from his debugging so far, the response from login.php is correct and the redirect to the account page happens, but local.username is still ""
    - is it not working correctly, setting through localActions?
    - or is it being overridden somewhere, like due to cross tab communication or the worker?
  - also says it happens on both BBGM and FBGM, and that it happens regardless of how many windows are open
  - console.log(document.cookie) - he says this returns an empty string, so i guess the cookie isn't being set somehow
    - would explain things, if cookie was not being set somehow. but should also be checked on account.basketball-gm.com directly

add toggle to table, to turn it into a heatmap showing which values are high or low. like think on a player stats table

- things this would enable
  - sliders to control talent levels
  - @nicidob Add an option to float the salary cap. Have it come from something like Sum(hype * population). So if NY/LA/CHI/MXC have bad teams, it's worse! Maybe even have hype depend on team rating (so if the whole league is playing crappy teams then the cap goes down).

sw cache issue
- might have been due to index.html being cached by cloudflare. that's disabled now (feb 8). it things don't improve, add logging in sw.js to send version to index.html, and then attach that to error log in bugsnag
- could also store quota amount in log
- looks like it could be old sw staying active somehow
- try to reproduce on low disk space

nicidob - Something like "Team Hall of Fame" based on wins/MOV/playoff. And some way to see in-season MOV graphs, and multi-season MOV/Win%/PowerRanking

Jofish - when you make a move that causes an error in your roster (i.e. not enough/too many players) and try to simulate the all-star game, it freezes. I understand that the game still has to check if the rosters are proper, however, there is no warning given. Even though it doesn't make sense that the user's roster has to comply within the league even though it's the all-star game, a simple warning given would be nice

turnover in 2 point conversion -> wrong team still kicking off, wtf

team rating

  - stored value will also make power rankings simpler and faster
- show on other pages, like team history
- team potential rating?
- somehow show everywhere, like how RatingsStatsPopover is for players
- change scale, make it harder to get 100?
  - but also don't make there be no variation in default leagues. maybe make it nonlinear 90+

god mode options
- population growth
- salary cap growth
- inflation of other revenue/expenses
- make them constant, or from a random distribution?

bundle size by removing dependency (tested by adding to "external" in rollup config)

If you don't control your server, that's not very helpful.

blocked fg too uncommon?

Just started playing the other day and it's pretty fun! A lot different than BBGM but the roster management is fun even if the games can feel kind of random. Few things stood out. Not sure if this is just for balance purposes, but teams are WAY stricter about giving up next year's 1st round picks than in real life. I can package 3 amazing players and the best I get offered is a 1st 4 years in the future. Meanwhile IRL 1st rounders get traded for much less (Cooper for a 1st straight up).

Also I wonder if there is a way to present a player's value in regards to the position they play. What I mean is if I want to draft a good RB in the game I have to invest an early pick, but in the NFL teams find starting RBs day 3 on a pretty regular basis (although the argument there is OL is more important for the run game than the RB) so that might actually be pretty complicated to implement.

Finally I saw dumbmatter mention this in the initial post, but there really should be guaranteed rookie contracts. They are basically standard in the NFL and I don't see why a simulation wouldn't mirror this. Just feels weird all my players only want 2 year contracts when they are usually stuck with the team for 4 years at least. Just some initial thoughts, great work overall!

keyStats for OL should not show tiny # of tackles

Great players retire too early

rookie contracts too high still?

situationally aware play calling
- pass or run, hurry up or milk the clock with lead
- kneeling to run out clock
- clocking ball to stop clock
- hail mary as a separate play type?
  - needTouchdown

if paying a lot to a QB already, don't sign another expensive one

Also I just had my rookie QB get onto the All-Rookie Team in the QB slot, but he was also slotted in as an All-Rookie punter, without having done any punts all season.

stat distribution pages

too many players playing both offense and defense
- reassess after making roster construction better. if it's still a problem, only allow starter at one position
- too many fat guys with elite speed, small guys with elite strength?

weight formula is not very good

confirm subscription works from football-gm.com
- Basketball GM Gold -> GM Gold, BBGM Commissioner -> The Commissioner in bbgm-account
- cross promote in welcome emails

redo pot formulas?

Add "All Seasons" option to various stat/ratings pages
- Player Ratings
- Player Stats
- Team Stats
- League Leaders
  - Also add "Career Totals" there

injury later
- slowly ramp endurance up after injury
  - really, the injury should just impact endurance and odds of reinjury. if you want to force someone to play through an injury, go for it
- injury history leads to chance of reinjury
- height influences injury probability (see same paper as age)

exportPlayerGamesCsv only supports basketball currently, and it's disabled in ExportStats.js. football box scores are more complicated, more derived stats

way to specify routes for ShotLocations/RosterContinuity/Depth, so they aren't included in football/basketball routes

game sim
- pick playType from (down, toGo, scrimmage, score, quarter, time)
- later
  - clock
    - pace
    - clock management, strategy
  - for 2 point conversions and extra points, penalties don't actually move scrimmage currently!
  - log clutch plays
  - blocked fg
    - count as missed field goal
    - chance for either team to return (very slim for offense)
  - blocked punt
  - missed fg/xp return

AV advanced stat
- use in value?
- OL and defense
  - need all pro modifier - but this is circular reasoning, since that comes from AV!
  - in individualPts, check if they actually seem to apply (no substantial rushing/receiving/passing stats)

what's the end state here? options:
- everything is in deion, and process.env.SPORT governs the output
  - that'd be nice, but probably unrealistic
- define minimal set of things that need to be overridden, and pass to deion like new DeionUI({...}) - probably this one!!!!!!!
  - e.g. views.. put routes.js and views/index.js in deion. but views/index.js will only have common ones. for others, pass into DeionUI, and reference both sets of views in genPage in routes.js
  - do this, but try to also do the process.env.SPORT solution when possible
- deion remains a set of functions/classes/modules, to be pulled in externally piecemeal. if something internal needs to be overriden, make it generic or a factory or DI or have it accept a parameter to allow overriding

how to get types working, options:
- make anything depending on an override or sport-sepcific type into a factory function or generic, initialized in deionWorker or deionUI and then passed around
- pass around overrides manually everywhere, not making it a module
- move everything inside deion

how will deionUI(overrides) work with types?
- can pass them as generics, then apply them to factory functions
- Import modules from deion. Add things like extra views. Apply factories/generics.

type better
- skills/compositeRatings - should be RatingsKey, not string for components. And PlayerRatings
- PlayerStatType should be sport specific
- getCopy/getCopies and Cache
  - awards should return Awards
  - players and playersPlus - Player<> and Player<MinimalPlayerRatings> should be Player<PlayerRatings>
- most MinimalPlayerRatings uses should be generic and take PlayerRatings

split more from deion
- processInputs for views only in one sport (depth, shot locations)
- worker API functions only in one sport (depth)

yarn workspaces
- see branch football-yarn-workspaces - all works except karma

show game stats in player page

contract demands and position assignments should be based on which position maximizes p.value, not which position maximizes ovr. would you rather have an 80 ovr qb or a 100 ovr kicker?

RatingsOverview - could put in deion, with config to specify categories and names from getCols
- RatingsForm has this already! re-use

---

on import, error if any player/draftPick references an invalid tid

on league import, override numTeams if teams are supplied in league file

during free agency, after you sign all your free agents it should automatically take you to the league free agents and skip the step of having to continue

if a trade is highly unfavorable to the user, pop up a warning confirmation dialog

live game
- field with drive summary, football, direction, and last play

more accurage game sim
- State machine. Simulate flags. Distinguish scrimmage and ball position. Transaction rollbacks
  - https://thisrobot.life/guides/comparison-with-xstate.html

---

in table, sort position by constants.POSITIONS order (like roster page in football)

revise re-signing - too many good young players become FAs

everywhere contract is displayed, make it in italics if not guaranteed
- currently only on roster i think. make a component!

Add playoff seed # to the history page

option to have no draft, players just become FAs

"Accept Trade" button on trading block

AI teams should adjust finances
- and reset after user is fired

better salary AI
  old players undervalued
  dynamically set based on cap space
  https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/4omk8h/simulating_marketbased_pricing/
  FAs less likely to sign https://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/4qla6t/free_agent_mood/d4ww715?context=3

if an ad blocker is used, no need to save that space on the right
- already done for Gold/localhost in initAds, but how to do it for ad blocker too?

open dashboard, open league in new tab, now shell on dashboard is as if in league
- happens because there is no way to distinguish "local.updateGameAttributes called to initialize new league that the user clicked from the dashboard in this tab" and "local.updateGameAttributes called from another tab, but this tab has lid === undefined so we'll leave it in that state"

login -> account -> doesn't say logged in, sometimes? but account shows in navbar
- happens if you log in in one tab while having another open, then in the 2nd tab go to achievements
  - only in firefox?
  - no, user says chrome too

service worker - workbox
- more explicit upgrades https://deanhume.com/displaying-a-new-version-available-progressive-web-app/
  - workbox-window

https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/app-install-banners/

after preseason, after player development, recalculate player value
- use ovr vs PER formula, but with offset based on prior value

Don't allow play if versions in tabs don't match
- close worker?

---

React.StrictMode
- react-sortable-hoc findDOMNode
  - switch to react-movable works, except in Safari https://github.com/tajo/react-movable/issues/30
- reactstrap findDOMNode

to send notification to correct screen, need `conditions` in views/allStars (and other getOrCreate calls). should be possible right? yeah, could request hostID from shared worker, and then sent it to runBefore functions, but... is it worth it? maybe not

BoxScoreRow
- link to team should be for the season of the ASG, not current season always (in boxScore.season but not passed to Row)
- highlight user team abbrev

Difficulty fudge factor should only be for user team (finances, trades)
- for trades this is hard because valueChange does not know if it's the user's team or not, need to accept another parameter

re-evaluate contracts
- somehow market based

make AI smarter about contracts
- then do cool shit, like a tunable "randomness" factor or something that lets you tune player development, and also overall talent level, and also distribution of different ratings (to sim different eras)

somewhere, show average age of team

increase PG cutoff
- https://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/8lfyuh/7_center_turns_into_pg_when_the_season_starts/

index updating
- currenty: check if the indexed property has changed, and only update a specific index then
- would be better: make _dirtyIndexes per index, not per store  
- even better: incrementally update index

later
- in new league: set rookie contracts appropriately
- in new league: initialize rebuilding/contending to non-random values
- don't include core.debug in prod builds?
- steeper penalties for unbalanced lineups
  - increasing perimfactor not enough - need to reevaluate formula. see all_bigs.json
    - perimfactor shouldn't be needed. just use the synergy stuff. should be offense and defense. check values for normal and extreme teams
- simulate draft from past seasons, to correctly assign contracts (don't need to populate actual draft info)

NEED TO FIX TRADE AI
- make tests of trades that should/shouldn't happen
- example: should never offer a strictly worse pick for a better pick. or at least not commonly

no POT mode, to make it harder

persist fantasy draft results
- make an array of draft results
- viewable somehow - need to track when fantasy drafts happened and add them to draft results menu

---

more flexible auto play - shorter period of time, individual phases, etc. would require non-alert dialog

1. If there was a "select all" for not including draft picks in trades. So instead of going down 1 by 1 to check don't include you could just say NO to trading any of your 4,000 picks. 

2. If searching player rating also included contracts. Usually you'll want to find a high potential guy on a cheap contract.

career totals on player pages https://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/7ya1yu/any_more_thoughts_on_the_beta/duptp08/?context=3

open multiple leagues from dashboard at the same time - Invalid cache status "filling"
- looks like flush is being called while status is "filling", can that be short circuited since idb.cache has been redefined? lid is different, or the hostID is different?
  - happens because it calls "flush" when closing an existing open database. should be more explicit about state of loading (no league loaded or loading, league X loaded and no league loading, league X loaded and league Y loading, no league loaded and league Y loading)
  - then will also need a way to prevent UI errors, if a UI update function is running and expects e.g. g to be populated but it's not - UI should check the aforementioned state as well and wait for loaded

reevaluate FA system - too easy to rebuild
- too many young stars available
- first pick at most players

move react up, before worker is initialized, so compareVersions error can be displayed there

somehow display synergy, maybe on roster page

watch list players should result in notifications when things happen (FA salary drops, trades, signings, release, retire)
- https://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/7h3eqy/simple_feature_request/

advanced team stats
- strength of schedule: https://www.pro-football-reference.com/blog/index9e6d.html?p=37&cpage=1
  - to set up this system of equations, need to know the schedule, but that is not stored anywhere currently. need to persist original schedule. maybe only soft delete games as they are played, or copy to another table?
  - use https://www.npmjs.com/package/linear-solve to solve
- team ortg/drtg/nrtg adjusted for strength of schedule

box plus/minus
- https://www.basketball-reference.com/about/bpm2.html
- http://www.apbr.org/metrics/viewtopic.php?p=35755#p35755
- VORP

advanced stat table too confusing? needs vertical dividers/spacing?

use something besides PER in player value formula

new adv stats in roster page?
- switch PER to WS/48 - roster.js now pulling both, then eventually switch Roster.js
- same for HoF
- OR, wait for BPM?

per 100 possessions and totals toggle on team stats page

- https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/71e7a7b1e0df42df4ee47a01a6218adf40e99cda/packages/babel-compat-data/data/plugins.json

remove polyfills
- get rid of getAll polyfill when safari 10.x usage goes to 0
- others too!

add franchise leaders (stats) to team history page

marker for feats from the playoffs/finals https://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/6gpf1f/suggestion_a_marker_of_some_sort_next_to_game/

some way to see draft picks by team, now that there are AI trades

AI trades
- notification? only for big trades. quantify! maybe show that info in transactions page too

AI propose trade to user
- need way to show popup with link to trade page

colors
- color ratings on ratings page (and tables), just like ratings popup
- color stats in ratings popover

force single tab per league
- when < 5 seconds, wait for another heartbeat before deciding
- check for collission in setInterval, and somehow show error page if that happens

shared worker
- namespace stuff, after it's working for one league
  - attach lid to promiseWorker instance in host (call it "metadata"), update lid if it changes, and attach to every request from host
    - then from worker, pass into toUI
  - query API: flag to determine if broadcast or single response. default single response. optional last arg, so single response use case is same API as now
    - if broadcast, then response is always undefined
    - broadcast needs to be namespaced, too. like only "update all league 5" not "update all tabs open in every league"
      - figure out some way to abstract... like maybe a conditional broadcast function defined based on metadata
  - namespace leagues (or force only one league)
    - namespace locks, g (in worker only), idb.league, and idb.cache
    - all common functions, accept g as param
    - something to handle init/close of tabs
    - look at all toUI calls
  - disconnect league when none are left registered to promise worker (so need api to get all metadata)

when dirty on close, show warning window, and initiate flush (if not already in progress)
- hard to coordinate across UI and worker...

better loading screen, after React takes control but before initial page is rendered - because it can be slow for loading a league

this shit is UGLY UGLY UGLY, fix ASAP!!!
    if (typeof it === 'function') { return; }
  http://railsware.com/blog/2017/01/10/mocking-es6-module-import-without-dependency-injection/

get tests working
- db.getCopy.teams
  - operate on individual functions? can export them just for tests
  - confirm operations that don't require IDB
  - confirm getAll updates from cache

refactor
- clear, delete need to handle indexes

document cache data format and API!
- different things are cached, depending on object store
- all modifications go into cache
- cache mutations are dangerous, see getCopy
- read from just the cache if you're sure everything is there (like an active player). otherwise, read from db and augment with cache (because anything could be in cache, even if it's not normally.. like retired player added to watch list). getCopy variables do this
- promise microtask worker crap - for firefox support, if you start a backboard tx manually, you can't do any promise/asyncawait stuff inside the callback

----

situational awareness
- possession length
  - ? timeouts to advance ball (shorter possession) or make subs
  - ? shot clock violation
- fouls
  - ? sometimes foul when up 3 and not much time left
  - ? hack a shaq
- rotations
  - ? play stars more at the end of close games
  - ? sub in good FT shooters in late game situations

  bump up penalties for unbalanced teams
    the tricky part is that finding a factor and using it to create variance leads to variance on the CPU-generated teams
    could play with turnover probability too
    rewrite gamesim, fixing all these problems? also, coaching less agressively when game is blowout, playing stars more in important games, ...
    tricky: good teams have high skill players, who are going to do really well in any synergy metric. so it's hard to punish unbalanced teams through synergy without decreasing parity by a lot
      hacky approach: stay with something similar to current system, but with an extra penalty for very unbalanced teams (could be sigmoidal so it only affects really poorly balanced teams)
    probably will need to increase synergyFactor
    might need to tweak some probabilities if this changes stats too much

PLAYER DEVELOPMENT REVAMP
-------------------------

shouldn't have literally every aging player turn into a great shooter

old players are currently undervalued

Too many good free agents available at the minimum: http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2sxs4l/love_the_game_suggestion_for_free_agency/

TEAM.VALUECHANGE REVAMP
-----------------------

https://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/585af3/the_trade_ai_is_too_easy_to_abuse/
loyalty: players should be reluctant to leave teams they've been on for a while.
http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2v26p1/how_are_you_exploiting_the_trade_ai/
http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/255sta/i_think_we_need_longer_dynasty_achievements/che050a?context=3
IMPORTANT http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/20i6v3/still_too_easy_to_trade_for_drafted_players/
  just drafted players are undervalued, possibly related to the following issue
second round draft picks are undervalued. also, giving away a pick should never make a trade worse, but sometimes it does now. http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2bg3zx/simple_feature_mark_players_as_offlimits_when_we/cj5ap89
  similarly, trading block for nothing can net you second round picks
trade for tons of cheap second round picks, then use that to trade for good asset: www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/27wjnp/33_pennies_for_a_dollar/
release and resign pick exploit http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1zn61h/finances/cfvzr35\
some limit on trades so people can't make 1000 slightly beneficial trades: http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1zzwbs/suggestions_on_trades/cg0e0dg
  probably make opposing owners less likely to trade as the number of proposed trades increases in a season
Eventually:
  "What would make this work?" functions should know about contending/rebuilding. Contending teams should be more eager to offer up young/cheap players, rebuilding teams should be more eager to offer up old/expensive players
    basically, they should view the trade from the other team's perspective, not just their own
  Can I provide better feedback about trade? Like if it's close or not? Or if it's rejected because of cap space issues?
  Set params with optimization algorithm
  Fix needToDrop stuff
    Problem now is, contract gets pushed into someone on the roster and it's lost. This is especially obvious if there is only one player in add and his contract is pushed to roster, then the trade is nothing.
    Probably not that important, since teams almost always have shitty players at the end of their rosters
  EXPLOIT that might be tricky to solve: in the "resigning players" phase, your free agents should still count towards your cap. Otherwise, you can trade to take on salary and then sign your players over the cap
  Should draft pick contract "worth" be determined better somehow, like it is for normal contracts? probably yes
    does this allow removal of fudge factor?
  population (i.e. richness) should influence opinion of contracts

BIG NEW GAMEPLAY CHANGES
------------------------

Extended free agency
  order of AI team signings shouldn't be linear
  0 year contracts http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1p0sa8/new_feature_extended_free_agency/ccy4gvp
  AI teams can release players to sign a better free agent?
fix contracts, signing
  goal: reasonable total payrolls, no good free agents left every season
  if WS distribution matches NBA, then look at $ vs WS. even better, build a multivariate model with age
  contracts should take ratings into more account, since stats on a good team are inflated and stats on a bad team are depressed

    too easy to get high percentage inside looks even with a team of all bigs?
    or should some of the "bigs" really be smalls, just mislabeled as PFs?
  make it less easy to get high percentage shots if there is no ball handling
    tweak perimFactor and synergyFactor.
  increase turnovers, particularly if perimFactor (or similar) is low
  increase fouls if perimFactor (or similar) is low
  assists should be function of speed, since those players have the ball more
  situational awareness http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1yg6wi/end_of_game_simulation/
  mediocre players on bad teams should be less efficient (shouldn't put up such a high PER, which falls if they join a good team)
add free agent to the end of roster
"My Player" mode http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2swmwj/there_should_be_a_game_like_myplayer_in_2k/cntkvj4

MINOR FIXES
-----------

documentation
  http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2agxoe/questions_and_suggestions_from_a_new_player/
Add MVP and Titles columns to HoF table
Make good young players much less likely to become FAs
don't need to store abbrev with awards, just tids
  fix display in season summary (correct in historyAll)
show team records in playoffs page
on team history, show counts of conf/league championships, hall of fame players, etc
if a player refuses to resign, that decision should also be reflected in free agency (don't recalculate mood)
add "drb" to usage so that good ball handlers shoot more (favor guards over bigs more)
in player page, show red/green for ratings changes from the previous year, maybe as heatmap
in ratings tables, show dpot and dovr columns? maybe?
league leaders glitch http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1r20x5/league_leaders_bug/
merge game.play and freeAgents.play
replace random.gauss with random.realGauss
don't need to check every team's roster limits every time games are played - could auto keep AI teams in line after any trade (with user or between AI teams), and then only the user's team needs to be checked
schedule page (and dashboard and maybe gamelog) should show opponent records

LOW PRIORITY
------------

track longest W/L streaks
tooling
  istanbul https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-coverage
team chemistry http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2oco2a/simple_suggestion_team_chemistry/cmrpap6?context=3
use compound index on season + team for games obectStore in helpers.gameLogList, views.leagueDashboard, maybe elsewhere
upcoming free agents page should show at least some information about signings (or non-signings) during re-sign phase
box plots / distributions
  "it'd be great to overlay your roster to see where you stand. Maybe click on a name in a list to add or remove it from the display. Do I have a fast team? Do I have a three point shooting team? Are we big and bruising and slow?"
compare players http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1saclf/suggestion_compare_players/
awards
  show awards count in hall of fame
add numbers for players
  ability to retire numbers
fantasy draft
  when fantasy draft is over, go to summary of the draft
    do this in core.draft.untilUserOrEnd
  add entry for fantasy draft summary to draft history dropdown?
league settings
  enable/disable trading rules
cross-league play
mobile UI, bootstrap 3
  do something about hover tooltips
    injury
    skills
      for injury and skills, maybe make the whole block a hyperlink that opens a popover
        make sure to use on player page too.. can i use helpers.playerName.. there too?
    table headers
    others?
some kind of playoff series overview page, including box scores for easy access
luxury tax money should be redistributed to non-taxpaying teams (or teams under the cap?)
A year-to-date comparison of team finances with the previous year.
more detailed player moods - http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1k4val/players_refusing_to_sign_bug/cbln1oo?context=3
  player personality, team chemistry
  http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1tkw3e/idea_player_traits/
dashboard info should be on a widget accessible from any screen
player search page
  show stats, ratings, contract, etc. (customizable); allow filters to be applied. also filter by skill icon
  search by stats, ratings, or attributes
  trade for button, or sign button if free agent, or draft button if draft prospect
    same contextual buttons for watch list
    can this become main UI for drafting (at least fantasy draft)
finances
  too easy to make big $$$
    owner should take profits each year
  AI teams should adjust spending
player morale - punishment for tanking
harsher, more realistic luxury tax
midlevel exception
more refined control of playing time
  http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1j1e6q/i_made_a_singleplayer_basketball_management/cbaegpq
  http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1qaml8/playing_time_explain_to_me_like_im_8/
  just set minutes directly? any minutes not included, leave up to coach's discretion
draft
  randomness in picks should factor in relative ratings http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1l1713/the_draft_still_needs_some_work_it_seems_my/cbutw7v?context=1
trades between AI teams
  each day, pick two random teams. if a trade can be found that both teams like, do it
    generalize core.trade.makeItWork and other parts of core.trade
  transaction log is necessary to keep tabs on this stuff
  also propose trades to the user, somehow
core.team.valueChange should be used to pick which free agents to sign in core.freeAgents.autoSign, but that would be a bitch beacuse of how transactions are set up
  also for resigning players in core.season
trades
  cash
    estimate value of cash - different for different teams? depending on cash, net profit recently, and market size
    upper limit? what is NBA rule?
  more feedback from AI
    if trade is close/far from working, return different messages
    display some indication of what a team wants to do on the trade view, e.g.
      "I need to cut my payroll and start making more money."
      "I could really use a good rebounder."
  sign and trade (only during resigning phase)
god mode
  options
    disable ratings display
  edit other player attributes (draft, etc)
export/import roster
  some way to specify startingSeason
  easily edit in excel?
increase hype for big free agent signings
how to handle aggregating stats for players who played for more than one team in a season? add them all up in ps in db.getPlayers
  for roster, want just a player's stats with this team this season
    this currently works, just pass a tid
  for player stats view, want total among all teams for one season
    no pass tid and you only get the latest row. need added logic to do sum
  for player view, want separate and combined rows in careerStats without fucking up totals (including PER)
    no pass tid and you get each team separately, but no merged stats as above
contracts
  maybe make them nonlinear.. role players lower, stars higher
    compare to NBA contract distribution
if fouling out drops team below 5 active players, play fouled out players but add a FT each foul (technical)
show old contracts on old roster view
core.trade refactoring
  validateSavedTids crap should be in trade.js.
  trade.summary stuff should be automatic and stored in tradeStore
  trade and clear buttons should be disabled during gameSim, with message like in team finances
final score, hall of fame
  influenced by size of city (see: difficulty in views.newLeague)
AI modules that contain functions which are called to determine actions
  things to regulate...
    draft picks
    signing free agents
    resigning players
    trades
    budget items (like from team finances view)
    releasing/buying out players when over limit
some UI showing the state of the team's synergy. maybe like an advisors screen that suggests what kind of player is needed to improve synergy
  also can respond to budget changes
  more general: have "media" reporting things like 10 worst contracts, etc
like on team finances page, anywhere else to add help popups?
  should this be abstracted rather than just inline in views?
  inline anything from the manual?
player mood should affect AI team signings - or should it?
  for resigning players
  for signing free agents
AI updating of *Budgets and ticket prices
  maybe not necessary at this stage?
  call core.finances.updateBudgetRanks() after
update formulas
  nationalTvRevenue
    same for each team, change contract year by year and display in team finances
  localTvRevenue
    eventually, t.seasons[0].tvContract

@TheRealGWood#4891 Team traits
  Have you ever played CK2?
  I ask because the more comments I see like that reddit post the more simple I think replacing Mood with traits would work. 
  CK2 uses them. You can created TRID trait ID store as 1-10 or something fir starters-
  Injury prone - 10% higher injury frequency 
  Chronic injury- 20% higher injury chance, 10% higher - result from injury 
  Erratic- -5 Mood, -5 for every other erratic or Ego
  Ego- +5 mood, -10 minutes under 30 or usuage under 28%
  Demands a Trade- Won’t resign. -10 team mood 
  Team leader- +5 team mood, +1DIQ team, +1 OIQ team
  Savy Vet- better team progs, +1 team mood , unhappy if losing 
  Team player- +1 team mood
  Ball hog- -1 team mood +1 mood if usuage over 25%
  Farewell season- +3 in all traits final game and forced retire at end of season, +1 team mood
  Franchise player - (only over 70’s) max 1 per team or mood= -10, 
  Star- team mood + 0.5, savy vets more likley to sign 
  Bookworm- +3 OIQ/DIQ 
  Idiot- -3 OIQ/ DIQ , team mood -1

  Team traits-
  Deep playoff run= (CF) team mood+ 2
  Chip- team mood +1
  Got a star- team mood +2
  Has franchise player- Team mood +1
  FAiled to make playoffs ect....

  This would allow for DM to later add:
  Lazy
  Hardworking
  Workaholic

  Out of Shape 
  Prime Shape 

  Streaky 
  Consistent 

  Clutch
  Choke artist 

  And settable traits-
  Minutes restriction 
  Load management 
  Sixth man (won’t start)
  Primary ball handler 
  Primary scorer 
  Go to Shooter

FUTURE
------

event log UI
  allow filtering type with checkboxes
  what about events with no tid? they are currently not viewable
shot charts showing hot spots (red/yellow/green) based on shot location data
If you are simulating through the whole season and execute a trade while simulating, it will continue simulating even if you are over the roster limit. http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1xch01/trades_after_season/cfamo73
hire/fire different coaches with different strategies
boxplots for shot location stats, plus comparison to NBA data
import/export stuff
  online "locker" that you can sync saved games to
  league names
    "Edit" button between "Export" and "Delete" - set in leaguesStore and gameAttributes
      move delete/edit/export under one button, "manage". have the 3 buttons pop out in place when you hit manage, then it functions as it does now. popped buttons can be colored too, then
moving to other cities
team finances view
  compare bar graphs against league averages?
different size stadiums, building new stadiums
tv revenue as a variable
  local tv contract - $10 million
    base on tvContractAmount, tvContractExp
    will be a deal from 3 to 5 years in length
    based on...
      region population
      "hype"
      random noise
      "random event" - competition between two networks, Sports TV and The Basketball Channel
    when renegotiating and really bad, the guy pretends not to know you - "Atlanta Herons? Is that the team from the Mexican/Canadian/Arena/Indoor/Xtreme Volleyball/Soccer/Tennis/Racing/Curling/MudWrestling League?"
input to helpers.formatCurrency (and all currency in variables everywhere) should be in 1000s of dollars and then only converted to millions when displayed
AI teams should have to deal with fuzz too
views.teamFinances should merge db call with team.filter to get seasonAttrs, but that will require rewriting seasonAttrs handling in team.filter to handle multiple seasons.
live play-by-play simulation
  slow it down http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1pu92x/new_feature_live_playbyplay_simulation/cd6xq54?context=3
  change of possession with no rebound/turnover?
  could fake where the shots are to display graphically
  allow the user to make substitutions in realtime
multi team trades
