OVERALL ROADMAP:
year filter
    stats
    game log
set minutes in roster window
generate box scores dynamically
add more players/teams to the database
scheduling
salaries, free agents, trades
player development/aging
draft
playoffs

SOME TIME:
save file should be compressed
improve game simulation code
can't save game, trade players, reorder roster, etc... while simulation is running!
use a new thread for game simulation: http://aruiz.typepad.com/siliconisland/2006/04/threads_on_pygt.html
    look at conduit code for inspiration, particularly the DB stuff - Database.py and http://svn.gnome.org/viewvc/conduit/trunk/tools/test-db-wrapper/main.py?view=markup
