MAIN PLAN:
build init_db equivalent with indexeddb
port enough code over to create a new league. is it ridiculously slow?
if not, port enough code over to simulate games. is it ridiculously slow?

IF NOT, THEN:
refactor, blah blah blah
other feature porting

handlebars templates -f js/templates.js

On page load:
- load main wrapper template and display
- load league internal wrapper but don't display
- if within league and internal league wrapper not displayed, display it
- display content from view (title, content, league_content)
  - do this within the view functions. have a function they call, passing a hash with keys matching blocks, and then have that function update the page

TODO:
only pushstate in ajax_update if this is a new URL (not the current URL)
only need handlebars.runtime.js
