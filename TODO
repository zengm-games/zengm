main todo
- refactor player to get rid of Player class
  - make other places that used Player work
    - add functions that are commonly used, like adding a row to stats or ratings
- factor out ALL db access from views
  - use localstorage for schedule
  - generalized function to create players list. ask for what attributes, ratings, and stats are required, from what season. take a transaction (or store? or either?) too. then execute callback with players as input
    - see getPlayers in views.js
  - ALL! for instance, after converting player.Player into a set of functions rather than a class, have db.savePlayer() or whatever
    - in all db access functions, accept a transaction as a first argument. if not given, then start a new transaction.
- resigning old players
  - negotiationList
- other views
- reassess how money is stored (ones, thousands, millions?)
strategic issues
- is localStorage fast enough for game_attributes, and possibly other stuff, like trades and contract negotiation?
- refactor and make sure i'm doing things correct as far as modules, namespaces, documentation, style, etc.
  - What will replace the AJAX calls? Just call api.whatever function directly and have it do the jQuery crap
- speed things up by combining transactions

---

BUGS

ratings should all be integers before being saved
playoff teams aren't being set in exactly the right order
are playoff wins added to regular season win total? looks like it.

---

PORTING NOTES:

team_attributes.playoffs is now team.made_playoffs
template loop count - how?
- conf rankings in standings
- class="separator"
  - box score (top 5)
  - standings (top 8)
startingSeason should be stored so later years can have different values
at some point, go through the indexeddb code. factor out common patterns into a library. combine transactions where appropriate
make sure all indexes are actually used. otherwise they're just making it slower for nothing

---

POLISH FEATURES

is dbm necessary?
- teamStore replaced by helpers.getTeams
- leagueStore replaced by localstorage of GameAttributes

test deep index stats.tid, stats.season: {pid, stats: {tid, season, pts, reb, ...}}

League schema: teamStats and playerStats refer to totals that will be divided by numGames to get averages

players = {playerAttributes, ratings: {playerRatings}, stats: {season, playoffs=Bool, numGames, playerStats}}
Index: *pid, tid, ratings.season, stats.tid, stats.season, stats.playoffs

teams = {teamAttributes, numGames, stats: {playoffs=Bool, teamStats}}
Index: tid, cid, did, season, stats.playoffs

games =  {gid, season, teamStatsForIndividualGame, playerStatsForIndividualGam}
Index: *gid, tid, season
- can tid be an array so that gid can be unique? can i index on an array?

playoffSeries = {season, currentRound, series: [[{}, ...], ...]}
- first row is for round, second row is for series, just like the series object in views.playoffs

schedule = {schedule}

conferences, divisions = simple global data structures

Querying based on multiple indexes: https://github.com/philikon/queryIndexedDB
Try that first, as it looks simple. If it doesn't work, try: http://linq2indexeddb.codeplex.com/ http://www.kristofdegrave.be/2012/05/using-linq-to-indexed-db.html
CAN EITHER OF THESE HANDLE JOINS? Intersection and Union in the first, what about second?

var teamStore = dbm.transaction("teams").objectStore("teams");
request = Index('did').eq(2).getAll(teamStore)
request.onsuccess = function (event) {
    console.log(request.result);
}

var dbConfig = {};
dbConfig.version = 1;
var db = window.linq2indexedDB("meta", dbConfig, true);
db.linq.from("leagues").select().then(function(data){
	console.log("Selected " + data.length + " items");
	console.log(data);
});

# Pre-JavaScript TODO

BUG: wrong payrolls shown in trade view - can i reproduce this?

BUG: player view for free agents doesn't work

fix commented lines in bbgm.core.season
- retired players - when to display notification?

database crap
- optimize
  - why is it so slow, and so disk thrashy?
  - are my keys correct/optimal/uptodate? unique keys? foreign keys?
  - MyISAM or InnoDB? barracuda? test
  - executemany
    - upgrade player ratings
- redo schema
  - separate dbs for leagues: what user permissions do i need, exactly? update README
  - normalize (especially the drafted table)
  - get rid of weird tables, replace with a key-value store table
  - get rid of "_attribute"
  - is games_in_progress really needed? just check timestamp
- sqlalchemy
  - game simulation progresses at about half the speed as when it was using straight mysqldb (although this has been somewhat ameliorated, it's only like 50% now). but maybe it's still worth it for flexibility with connection pooling, switching to postgresql, etc
  - sql queries with IN and "join" can use a list directly as bind parameter - doesn't work with mysqldb for lists with 1 element
  - postgresql
    - get rid of CONCAT
    - IFNULL
  - connection pooling?
- get rid of INSERTS in .sql file, instead have data elsewhere
  - then get rid of bulk_execute

player view
- next, previous buttons (also active on left/right arrows)
- http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#tabs
  - tab for game log
  - tab for playoff stats
- link to team roster
- for retired players, either don't show ratings, or show ratings from best year

roster
- "release" only sensitive with more than 5 players
- "buy out" only sensitive when there's enough money
- highlight handle on hover, like button
- "trade for" only sensitive when trades are allowed

datatables
- default to sort descending when column is clicked
  - http://datatables.net/ref#asSorting will work. maybe pass it as an option to bbgm_datatable

finances
- conditional formatting to show negative numbers in red: https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Adatatables.net+conditional+formatting&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=ubuntu&channel=fs

BUG:
- players ask for negative years contracts when resigning them
  - i think this is fixed..

Client-side game simulation
- 2: implement client-side
    - If no response after timeout expires, delete timeout, then unset lock and update play menu
- 2.5: fix javascript
  - http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/
    - Namespaces "A common problem of having only one global namespace" "In order to protect code against a possible overwritten undefined variable, a common technique used is to add an additional parameter to an anonymous wrapper that gets no argument passed to it."
      - just copy what jquery does
    - "For the best performance, it is recommended to always use the plain for loop and cache the length property. The use of for in on an array is a sign of badly written code that is prone to bugs and bad performance."
    - It is highly recommended to only use the strict equality (===) operator.
- 4: web workers? https://developer.mozilla.org/En/Using_web_workers
  - can spawn multiple workers in parallel. "transferable objects" would speed it up
- Robustness of javascript code
  - g.phase == 3 in league_views might introduce race condition
  - validate data from client?
  - make sure play menu doesn't ever get stuck - some kind of timeout

configuration in text file?
- http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/patterns/fabric/#the-configuration-file
- http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/2/

contract negotiation view
- bring back to either free agent view or resigning view after either accept or cancel

dashboard: a bunch of boxes showing..
- record
- playoff scenario
- history
- roster spots
- payroll
- expiring contracts
- top free agents
- league leaders
- team leaders

play menu
- just send everything over one juggernaut connection per league?

Single page application
- When a simulation is done (or a player is signed, or whatever), the current page should be reloaded
- during page reloads or back/forward... what about handling deeper content in URLs? i.e., what box score is being viewed? what year? what stat is sorted? what page in rankings? etc.
- when a form uses redirect_or_json, the URL isn't updated. not sure what the best way to fix that is.

move to new window button, like gmail, that will open a view in a new window with a minimal UI

play button requirements
- colors - is this a good idea?
  - green: move to new phase
  - blue: play games
  - red: other immediate action

make validate_season work correctly

include sidebar(s) showing all relevant information, plus make that stuff generated by a separate function so it can eventually be kept static as JS updates other content

grep for # links: grep -R --include="*.html" '<a href="#">' .

how to start/manage all these services?
- supervisor

security
- password hashing
  - http://packages.python.org/passlib/new_app_quickstart.html
- csrf protection
  - http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/security/#cross-site-request-forgery-csrf

- http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/70/

pep8
- https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8

playoffs
- on playoffs start, automatically switch to playoffs view
- link to team rosters... or better to link to a summary of the series?

# Then

trades
- allow trades that go over roster limit, but require players to be cut or traded to meet limit before game simulation continues

unit tests like https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask/blob/master/examples/minitwit/minitwit_tests.py

refactor player.py

self-contained game simulation code, to allow other people to hack on it easily. automatically make charts and stuff.

warning when window is closed and game simulation is in progress
- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1244535/alert-when-browser-window-closed-accidentally
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.onbeforeunload

abstract opposing team AI: make it a class with various methods to determine actions at different time points

game log
- pushstate for individual box scores as well as teams and seasons, somehow?

logging
- should be more ubiquitous

next redirect like http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/reqcontext/?highlight=url#diving-into-context-locals
- http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/62/

# BELOW IS OLD STUFF

Minor bugs:

Lottery should be for the 14 teams not in the playoffs, which isn't necessarily the same as the 14 worst teams.
Don't allow sort from first column of trade window

---

On release
- Update all version numbers (setup.py, README, about dialog box, save file, tables.sql (game_attributes), debian/changelog)
- Turn off debug mode

---
speed
- do simulations in C?

- unit tests
  - schedule

Separate files
- Each window/dialog gets its own glade file and own .py file in views folder
- initial build in each constructor DELETE THIS CRAP

Prettier UI: embed Webkit
- http://www.aclevername.com/articles/python-webgui/

when negotiating, players change values too much when you try to change years

pyflakes

======
FUTURE
======

GAMESIM
-------
overtime
take all ratings into account
blocks, assists (maybe other things) should not be so evenly distributed
home and away games
synergy
- Gameplay bonuses when any of the following are true...
  - At least one player with dribbling > X
  - At least two players with shooting_three_pointers > X
  - At least three players with shooting_three_pointers > X
  - At least four players with shooting_three_pointers > X
  - At least one player with rebounding > X
  - At least one player with blocks > X
  - At least three players with steals > X
  - At least one player with inside_scoring > X
  - At least three players with speed > X and (shooting_layups > X or shooting_layups + jumping > X)

UI
--
view any team in the roster window
    drop down box at the top with team names
    all actions disabled unless team_id == common.PLAYER_TEAM_ID
    open this window when a team is double-clicked on in the standings
customize which columns are displayed in treeviews - kiwi
treeview formatting
    str, int, float, currency, date, age - do formatting based on column type
progress bars
filtering should be done with treemodelfilter? - see pygtk tutorial
play menu
    even after hiding, accelerators still work, so on menuitem activation, check to make sure it's a valid choice!!!
        or: set accelerators in python code, not glade.  then i can reuse accelerators
ratings log tab on player window
some indication of synergy
toolbar to supplement the menubar
- New Open Save | Play (drop down menu) | Roster TeamHistory | Trade FreeAgents
league history
should trade window be a window or dialog?
update statusbar while game is saving/loading
player info window spawned from trade dialog and contract window should have clickable controls
- problem: a minimal example doesn't have this problem, so I don't know what's wrong
in team stats tab, allow toggle to show opponent stats

NBA
---
real salary cap rules: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Salary_Cap
    released players should count against cap
real contract rules (max/min, etc.)
allow contracts that aren't the same $ every year
team and player options
releasing players - see the salary cap wiki page for complicated rule
luxury tax: (team_salary - 65mil) penalty if team salary is > 65mil
trading deadline

BACKEND
-------
archive stats as averages - this will make the end of season awards feasible, and make the stats view faster/easier
uncertainty in rating - for each player, calculate a randn(0, 3) with max/min of +/- 5
    calculate a new one each year and add it to 1/2 of the previous one
teams should be smart in resigning players (now it's just random)
use constants for phase #'s, other things.  maybe create a dict CONST in common.py?
    confirm that teams always have at least 5 players

AI (NON-GAMESIM)
----------------
trade
- mechanism similar to free_agent_times_asked to prevent prolonged negotiations
- AI teams trade with each other
- opponent GM trade AI based on their team's status: contending or rebuilding
- record player value for contending and rebuilding teams in player_attributes, so opposing GMs can more easily suggest trades (i.e. "i'll make the deal if you throw in X")
- Feedback from trades (way off, that's close, etc)
- "Oh, you again?" after failed trade attempts
- AI teams should be aware of contract lengths and the implications thereof
AI teams release/buy out players to sign a better free agent

FEATURES
--------
injuries
opponent GM trade AI based on their team's status: contending or rebuilding
change prices of tickets, concessions, etc
hire coaches to influence development
different sized cities with differently passionate fanbases - affects attendance and home court advantage
multi-team trades... how can i make a good UI for that?
advanced stats (+/-, PER, etc)
punishment for going in debt: if cash is less than $10M, can't sign any new contracts
advisors
trades
- draft picks
- cash
- drop players as part of trade, to free up roster space
