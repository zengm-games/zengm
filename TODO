GOALS FOR 3.1.0
---------------

Main focus: AI improvements

trade draft picks
  fancy scrolling of summary box
team "value" and changes in team value. have a function that will return the change in team value for a given team if an array of players is added to the roster and an array of players is removed from the roster. if positive, then the trade/signing/drafting is good. if comparing multiple options, then the highest value is best.
  depends on team status - rebuildling or contending
  also come up with "value" for draft picks and cash which can be included in trades
  use core.team.valueChange for AI teams drafting, AI teams signing free agents
  algorithm
    weighted sum of different components, based on strategy:
      total player exp(value) difference
      skills added (weight by player value... no need adding a shooter who never plays)
      contracts
      youth (weight by player value)
      value of draft picks (est based on other team's record)
      cash
strategies of AI teams
  contending
    win games - if losing too much and players are aging, then switch
    make a profit - if losing too much money, then switch
    trade away draft picks
    resign free agents, going over the cap
  rebuilding
    dump big contracts
    dump older players
    position team so there will be a lot of cap space in a given year
    switch to "win now" if enough cheap/young talent is accumulated
    trade for draft picks
  when to switch between these strategies? or should it even be binary? maybe just have it as a continuous function of the team's roster, finances, and performance. then maybe put it through a sigmoidal function to bias a bit towards extremes
  should influence team.valueChange but not player.value
trades
  cash
    otherCash and userCash containing the amount
    estimate value of cash - different for different teams? depending on cash, net profit recently, and market size
    upper limit? what is NBA rule?
  more feedback from AI
    if trade is close/far from working, return different messages
    "What would make this deal work?" button
    display some indication of what a team wants to do on the trade view, e.g.
      "I need to cut my payroll and start making more money."
      "I could really use a good rebounder."
trades between AI teams
  each day, pick two random teams. if a trade can be found that both teams like, do it
  transaction log is necessary to keep tabs on this stuff
      ...
user can't just sign all the free agents before AI teams
"coaches" should factor in synergy

DB CHANGES SINCE 3.0.0
----------------------

draft stuff (object store and indexes)
  populate with 4 years starting with g.season (check phase for before/after draft)
draft.originalAbbrev and originalTid in player
userDpids and otherDpids in trade object store

EVENTUALLY
----------

refactor core.trade. it's an utter mess.
show championships in awards on player pages
all star game
some players foul way too much
team and league records (highest scoring game, etc)
switch teams after you're fired
source maps
  latest version of r.js (2.1.6) has an old version of uglify2 (2.3.2) which fails on a['3'] https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2/issues/207. newer version probably would fix that
  try errorception
trades
  allow trades to go over the roster limit, but show a warning. also factor into AI logic that they would have to drop a player
    warning should be in a different color than the error-like warnings
    after trade, AI drops player immediately
    don't allow game simulation if player's team is over limit - currently this is only checked at the beginning of the season, right?
  sign and trade (only during resigning phase)
profits too large, too easy
  add corporate tax?
  luxury tax increases for repeat offenders?
awards assigned based on wins added, like hof
when viewing a url like /l/1/roster, playing until new season shouldn't move it to roster for previous year
  this happens because inputs.season gets set even though it's not present in the URL. elegant solution?
only show retired players in season summary if they actually played some
Look at ratings distributions - should there really be so many bigs who are great passers, for instance?
components.dropdown tests are very slow in chrome
export/import roster
  some way to specify startingSeason
  download link performance
    http://mjtemplate.org/examples/rison.html
    something besides a data URI?
    no base64? Firefox can't handle #
  error handling if blank or invalid file is supplied
http://blog.stevensanderson.com/2013/05/20/knockout-es5-a-plugin-to-simplify-your-syntax/
move most db functions into core.whatever. db should just be about initializing/upgrading
  get rid of "db" module dependence
core.freeAgents should be core.freeAgent or core.freeAgency?
after last resigning negotiation, switch to next phase?
draft lottery
  do a dramatic presentation?
  increase hype for teams that exceed expectations
  tied records?
how to handle aggregating stats for players who played for more than one team in a season? add them all up in ps in db.getPlayers
  for roster, want just a player's stats with this team this season
    this currently works, just pass a tid
  for player stats view, want total among all teams for one season
    no pass tid and you only get the latest row. need added logic to do sum
  for player view, want separate and combined rows in careerStats without fucking up totals (including PER)
    no pass tid and you get each team separately, but no merged stats as above
better default league name
contracts
  maybe also try making contract demands depend on PER, if it is available
  maybe make them nonlinear.. role players lower, stars higher
    compare to NBA contract distribution
luxury tax should be disbursed amongst non-taxpaying teams
give bbgm website its own version of bootstrap (only with components needed)
team.rosterAutoSort should automatically set dbChanged, and have an option to not if that's important
test trades more
  multi-player valuation
    rank players by value. each additional value gets some multiplier to diminish its influence. this prevents adding a player to a trade from decreasing its value
    but this should have something to do with the difference between numbers of players on each side?
analytics
  should have no more referrals from basketball-gm.com since it's all set to the same domain now
  https://github.com/segmentio/analytics.js/
    analytics.pageview in lib/davis.google_analytics.js
    analytics.track to get rid of bbgmPing
    how to initialize GA with correct options?
notifications (and log) from top right to display log of key events
  game results from user's team
  players retiring from user's team
  league champions
  trades
  free agent signings
how to deal with a team that drops below 5 active players, factoring in injuries?
  should minimum roster size be higher?
  should allow them to exceed roster limit while injury exists
  should not allow play when below 5
  should use same logic/functions as core.season that checks on new season.
    first, add support for auto-add players when AI teams are below limit (in season.js)
  if fouling out drops team below 5, play fouled out players but add a FT each foul (technical)
check effects of extreme ticket prices
show old contracts on old roster view
force roster reorder handles to stay big even if window is small
reassess ui module. delete stuff like ui.dropdown. move other functions elsewhere?
  what is the difference between util.viewHelpers, views.components, and ui?
can i get rid of js/api.js?
IE10 support, if posible
  gameSim crashes browser
  davisjs for knockoutjs links in IE10
    elem.host comes up blank in originChecks
core.trade refactoring
  validateSavedTids crap should be in trade.js.
  trade.summary stuff should be automatic and stored in tradeStore
  trade and clear buttons should be disabled during gameSim, wiht message like in team finances
too easy to do the "be bad, get draft picks, keep payroll low, sign free agents, be good" pattern
  free agents are even less willing to sign with the user, even if it's a good team
final score, hall of fame
  influenced by size of city (see: difficulty in views.newLeague)
any raw data files should go in the data folder, ideally with a script to convert them to however they're used here
database changes
  add activeYears multientry like statsTids use for:
    league leaders
    stats
    ratings
gameSim
  rename compositeRating to compositeRatings (or something better)
    other plural issues in gameSim
  playing time not adding up to 240?
  do some kind of profiling, see if i can speed it up
    any way to speed up PER? maybe break it up into smaller functions so they can be profiled
    do i need all the player composite ratings?
    do i need all the team composite ratings?
    how does performance change/degrade as the years go on?
internationalization
  league dashboard rankings should say 1st, 2nd, 3rd rather than 1th, 2th, 3th
  http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#i18n
in lock functions, update g from database before using any potentially sensitive values
  or should these g.whatever variables be set at all if they're sensitive? lid doesn't change obviously, but the others?
move to new window button, like gmail, that will open a view in a new window with a minimal UI
  only the icon should be clickable, not the area above and below
AI modules that contain functions which are called to determine actions
  mode: rebuild or contend
  things to regulate...
    draft picks
    signing free agents
    resigning players
    trades
    budget items (like from team finances view)
    releasing/buying out players when over limit
show an option to upload a data file for rosters
  nba roster
    define file format for external player sources
    derive from stats, somehow?
    nba player potential ratings
    if necessary, scale everything down a bit to make it comparable to normal players
    free agents are way overrated. is this roster file legit?
player finder
  search by stats or ratings
  trade for button, or sign button if free agent
customize which columns are shown in roster view (and possibly other summary views like trade, free agent, etc)
  http://datatables.net/extras/colvis/
PER
  slow, particularly after multiple seasons?
    can i have it share a transaction with writing stats in core.game?
  how to deal with players traded mid-season?
    reevaluate this in general. stats don't seem to be showing after a trade in roster view and player view.
  use for awards, contracts
some UI showing the state of the team's synergy. maybe like an advisors screen that suggests what kind of player is needed to improve synergy
  also can respond to budget changes
more handlebars helpers for things like...
  team dropdown
  season dropdown
go through future list - anything that should be here?
DataTables - fix default sort order on column click
  text should be asc, numeric should be desc (except draft picks)
  http://datatables.net/ref#asSorting will work. maybe pass it as an option to bbgm_datatable
  but can it be set globally, based on column type? can have ui.datatable automatically read columns and figure it out?
more tests
  https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul
  https://github.com/metagriffin/indexeddb-js can i improve this and run tests outside of browser?
like on team finances page, anywhere else to add help popups?
  should this be abstracted rather than just inline in views?
  inline anything from the manual?
tweak gameSim for stats again
freeAgentMoods should affect AI team signings - or should it?
  for resigning players
  for signing free agents
bar graphs
  gradients like http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/components.html#progress
AI updating of *Budgets and ticket prices
  maybe not necessary at this stage?
  call core.finances.updateBudgetRanks() after
team finances template: handlebars helper for form DRY?
update formulas
  nationalTvRevenue
    same for each team, change contract year by year and display in team finances
  localTvRevenue
    eventually, t.seasons[0].tvContract
roster reordering
  make only handles draggable, not whole row
playoff seeding rules
  division winner should get at least 4th seed in playoffs, but still do homecourt by best record in a matchup

FUTURE (after 3.0.0)
--------------------

hire/fire different coaches with different strategies
jslint errors
  currently just "Don't make functions within a loop." which should all be fixed eventually
Web workers
  don't seem to actually help performance. maybe help responsiveness
  benchmark?
  would it be worth it to parallelize advstats?
boxplots for shot location stats, plus comparison to NBA data
import/export stuff
  online "locker" that you can sync saved games to
  https://unhosted.org/adventures/7/Adding-remote-storage-to-unhosted-web-apps.html
  data urls don't work with more than ~1 MB. downloadifydoesn't seem to work with more than several MBs of data. until a better solution comes (online sync?), wait.
  league names
    "Edit" button between "Export" and "Delete" - set in leaguesStore and gameAttributes
      move delete/edit/export under one button, "manage". have the 3 buttons pop out in place when you hit manage, then it functions as it does now. popped buttons can be colored too, then
  import league
    ignore old lid
other advanced stats
  WS - http://www.basketball-reference.com/about/ws.html requires Basketball on Paper - http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/about/ws.html is simpler
  +/- and other stats needed to calculate above - track in game
  APM?
hitting the phase twice shouldn't be possible. but if i, for instance, hit "until preseason" twice quickly, i skip a year
  maybe have something like lock.phaseChangeInProgress? but some timeout would be needed to reset
worth it to switch to closure library? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10782612/what-is-the-sturdiest-way-to-get-the-closure-compilers-type-safety-together-wit
roster size check on new season
  cpu teams with < 5 players should automatically sign free agents
moving to other cities
expansion teams (add population growth, expand when certain conditions are met)
team finances view
  compare bar graphs against league averages?
different size stadiums, building new stadiums
tv revenue as a variable
  local tv contract - $10 million
    base on tvContractAmount, tvContractExp
    will be a deal from 3 to 5 years in length
    based on...
      region population
      "hype"
      random noise
      "random event" - competition between two networks, Sports TV and The Basketball Channel
    when renegotiating and really bad, the guy pretends not to know you - "Atlanta Herons? Is that the team from the Mexican/Canadian/Arena/Indoor/Xtreme Volleyball/Soccer/Tennis/Racing/Curling/MudWrestling League?"
stat views
  add team dropdown to ratings and stats views - but should this refresh the view, or just filter the DataTable?
    could use something like http://www.datatables.net/extras/thirdparty/ColumnFilterWidgets/DataTables/extras/ColumnFilterWidgets/ to also filter on positions
  playoff/regular season toggle in team/player stats, league leaders
  player stats: toggle to only show players > 2000 minutes http://www.nba.com/leader_requirements.html
  per 36 stats in team/player stats view, league leaders
    add a dropdown (maybe make the dropdown handling code more general?)
bootstrap 2.3
https://github.com/nprapps/app-template
trading block
race conditions associated with callbacks when passing around transactions
  any put/add/update does not guarantee it's finished until the transaction finishes. but letting transactions finish is slow.
contract negotiation
  add free agent to the end of roster
eliminate jquery UI dependency? it's only used for roster reordering currently
real calendar
  player.injury.gamesRemaining
core.gameSim.updateSynergy should produce continuous output
  no big difference between a 80 rating and 79 rating, or whatever
input to helpers.formatCurrency (and all currency in variables everywhere) should be in 1000s of dollars and then only converted to millions when displayed
AI teams should have to deal with fuzz too
if play menu is open when it refreshes, automatically open it again after refresh
  not so easy.. tried it in 34927959b2b0acd08224665654343d97ffaea281 but there were issues with updatePlayMenu being called multiple times, for instance at the end of the season
"dbChanged" updateEvent - more correct way
  store a list of times and "update events". compare last updated time against that list, and then see the update events. pass as list in "update event" to realtime update
  check everywhere dbChange or lastDbChange is set and see if it should be more refined
    add playerMovement updateEvent, for when a player signs a contract, becomes a free agent, or is traded
bbgmView
  can i do some check to abandon display if idLoading is mismatched with reality? like for clicking a slow link followed by a fast link, in rapid succession, the fast output should show and the slow should be short circuited.
    in practice, this doesn't seem to matter much
  shouldn't have newPhase updateEvent doing much. instead, have an array of what changed in that phase
    (updateEvents.indexOf("newPhase") >= 0 && g.phase === g.PHASE.PRESEASON) should be newSeason
  use req.redirect from POST to manage history optimally
  make it less tied to BBGM specifically. shouldn't depend on BBGM-specific modules like g, ui, and util/viewHelpers
player development should depend on playing time
http://code.google.com/p/htmlcompressor/ or something similar
core.player.ovr shouldn't just average ratings together. some ratings are more important than others. do regression analysis against PER to prove this and find a better formula.
player.filter
  the special case attributes should generally be moved directly into the database?
views.teamFinances should merge db call with team.filter to get seasonAttrs, but that will require rewriting seasonAttrs handling in team.filter to handle multiple seasons.

Template Stuff
--------------

Below are relatively boring/minor improvements that would make the templating slightly better/faster/clearer/whatever.

gameLog
  boxScore should be observable, but nothing inside should be except gid
dashboard
  observables set right by mapping
    historical things (old scores, old records) don't need to be observable?
    arrays need correct keys
team finances
  smarter updating of player salaries table: contracts should only update on playerMovement
feasible to use knockout for updating datatable? or kogrid?
trade - not fully knockoutifieid
  mapping to update summary.teams.trade, userRoster, otherRoster
  can i do a redirect from post without refreshing everything?
    just call ui.realtimeUpdate which should allow for smart handling
      if trade is accepted/cleared, playerMovement will instigate a refresh of rosters
      if trade is proposed, message will somehow explicity be sent (set in VM? but what if VM not initialized?)
  when to delete stored message?
    at beginning of new propose
    on clear
    when team changes
  changing the trading partner shouldn't refresh the user's team
negotiation
  some things can probably be non-observable
draftSummary
  don't show this season as option if before draft - have an option in components.dropdown
playerNameLabels always updates even if none of the inputs did - why
  if ratings.skills is generated by the mapping plugin, it's an observable array and this fucks things up. it would be a bitch to fix, though.
    quick fix - return a string for templates rather than array.
leaders
  flatten a bit
roster
  check release, buy out, trade for
  flatten a bit
  vars.ptModifiers does not need to be observable
dataTables/grid knockout
  examples
    https://github.com/CogShift/Knockout.Extensions
      https://github.com/CogShift/Knockout.Extensions/issues/9
    https://github.com/Knockout-Contrib/KoGrid
    http://chadmullins.com/javascript/knockout-js-series-part-2-binding-knockout-js-to-a-datatables-grid/
inbox
  on new message (can be a newMessage update event), just add to messages list rather than always refreshing
player_
  face display with forward/back button?
    some things become observables - why???
    mapping function not run right the second time - try to create jsfiddle
      arrays are becoming observableArrays
schedule, teamHistory
  partial load of list for updates, like in gameLog list
freeagents
  optimize refreshes
dist
  allow updating box plots without refresh
gameLog
  set more stuff through mapping
reassess dropdown - should it really be called like it is in uiEvery? can i use a computed? problem is, some things need to listen to updateEvents too, not just observables

# Pre-JavaScript TODO

player view
  next, previous buttons (also active on left/right arrows)

roster
  highlight handle on hover, like button
  "trade for" only sensitive when trades are allowed

Client-side game simulation
  Robustness of javascript code
    g.phase == 3 in league_views might introduce race condition
    validate data from client?
    make sure play menu doesn't ever get stuck - some kind of timeout

play button requirements
  colors - is this a good idea?
    green: move to new phase
    blue: play games
    red: other immediate action

make validate_season work correctly

include sidebar(s) showing all relevant information, plus make that stuff generated by a separate function so it can eventually be kept static as JS updates other content

real salary cap rules: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Salary_Cap
real contract rules (max/min, etc.)
allow contracts that aren't the same $ every year
team and player options
releasing players - see the salary cap wiki page for complicated rule
trading deadline

AI (NON-GAMESIM)
----------------
trade
  AI teams trade with each other
  opponent GM trade AI based on their team's status: contending or rebuilding
  record player value for contending and rebuilding teams in player_attributes, so opposing GMs can more easily suggest trades (i.e. "i'll make the deal if you throw in X")
  Feedback from trades (way off, that's close, etc)
  "Oh, you again?" after failed trade attempts
  AI teams should be aware of contract lengths and the implications thereof
AI teams release/buy out players to sign a better free agent

FEATURES
--------
multi-team trades... how can i make a good UI for that?
