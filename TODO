OVERALL ROADMAP:
for roster: autosort, autoplayingtime
generate box scores dynamically
scheduling
salaries, free agents, trades
player development/aging
- random number of points based on age.  the younger, the better the odds are of improving
draft
playoffs

SOME TIME:
add more players/teams to the database
on start, window with New, Open, or Quit buttons rather than just starting a new game automatically
parallelpython to parallelize game simulation
improve game simulation code
can't save game, trade players, reorder roster, etc... while simulation is running!
use a new thread for game simulation: http://aruiz.typepad.com/siliconisland/2006/04/threads_on_pygt.html
    look at conduit code for inspiration, particularly the DB stuff - Database.py and http://svn.gnome.org/viewvc/conduit/trunk/tools/test-db-wrapper/main.py?view=markup
