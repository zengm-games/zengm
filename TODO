BLOCKERS FOR 1.0:
- "Synergy" in game simulation
  - Gameplay bonuses when any of the following are true...
    - At least one player with dribbling > X
    - At least two players with shooting_three_pointers > X
    - At least three players with shooting_three_pointers > X
    - At least four players with shooting_three_pointers > X

    - At least one player with blocks > X
    - At least three players with steals > X
    - At least one player with inside_scoring > X
    - At least three players with speed > X and (shooting_layups > X or shooting_layups + jumping > X)
  - Make sure all ratings are used adequately in simulation
- free_agent_times_asked stores the number of times the "sign" button is clicked. then, after 2 times, gradually increase demands, but only for the player
- set new free agent contract amount demand at beginning of each season
- test new free agent stuff
- hard limit on max roster size
  - draft
    - release players if necessary
- release/buy out players to sign a better free agent
- Awards window speed, especially for games with many seasons
- Add version number to save file
- test in unity and gnome 3
- Manual
  - Overview of gameplay
  - What do ratings mean? 80s=superstar, etc.
  - Relationship to NBA
  - Salary cap rules, contract rules, roster size rules, free agents, etc.
  - Synergy
- Make a .deb and distribute

All the other UI prettifying and code refactoring stuff can wait.

---

On release
- Update all version numbers (setup.py, README, about dialog box, save file)
- Turn off debug mode

---

Separate files
- Each window/dialog gets its own glade file and own .py file in views folder
- initial build in each constructor DELETE THIS CRAP

Prettier UI: embed Webkit
- http://www.aclevername.com/articles/python-webgui/
- first try for box score
  - how to make HTML links do external stuff
  - total rebounds
  - starters/bench distinction {% if forloop.counter == 5 %} separator{% endif %}
- then for standings
- then status/summary toolbar/sidebar
  - team
  - record
  - standings
  - finances: annual profit/loss, total cash/debt
  - history: total record, playoffs, championships, all star appearances, hall of fame selections
- Use theme settings for fonts and colors
  - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Quickly/Snippets "Get Gtk+ theme colors"


Player window and game log list should be sped up by not checking the old (static) rows

when negotiating, players change values too much when you try to change years
when you press close and the save/nosave/cancel dialog comes up, it should warn you about the save if you press save

continue factoring out game logic from views to core

pyflakes

FUTURE
======

GAMESIM
-------
overtime
take all ratings into account
blocks, assists (maybe other things) should not be so evenly distributed
home and away games

UI
--
view any team in the roster window
    drop down box at the top with team names
    all actions disabled unless team_id == common.PLAYER_TEAM_ID
    open this window when a team is double-clicked on in the standings
customize which columns are displayed in treeviews - kiwi
treeview formatting
    str, int, float, currency, date, age - do formatting based on column type
progress bars
filtering should be done with treemodelfilter? - see pygtk tutorial
play menu
    even after hiding, accelerators still work, so on menuitem activation, check to make sure it's a valid choice!!!
        or: set accelerators in python code, not glade.  then i can reuse accelerators
ratings log tab on player window
player info window spawned from trade dialog should have clickable controls
rapidly clicking and unclicking a player's checkbox on the trade window shouldn't open the player's info window
some indication of synergy
toolbar to supplement the menubar
- New Open Save | Play (drop down menu) | Roster TeamHistory | Trade FreeAgents
league history

NBA
---
real salary cap rules: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Salary_Cap
    released players should count against cap
real contract rules (max/min, etc.)
allow contracts that aren't the same $ every year
team and player options
releasing players - see the salary cap wiki page for complicated rule
luxury tax: (team_salary - 65mil) penalty if team salary is > 65mil

BACKEND
-------
archive stats as averages - this will make the end of season awards feasible, and make the stats view faster/easier
uncertainty in rating - for each player, calculate a randn(0, 3) with max/min of +/- 5
    calculate a new one each year and add it to 1/2 of the previous one
teams should be smart in resigning players (now it's just random)
use constants for phase #'s, other things.  maybe create a dict CONST in common.py?

AI (NON-GAMESIM)
----------------
trade
- AI teams trade with each other
- opponent GM trade AI based on their team's status: contending or rebuilding
- record player value for contending and rebuilding teams in player_attributes, so opposing GMs can more easily suggest trades (i.e. "i'll make the deal if you throw in X")
- Feedback from trades (way off, that's close, etc)
- "Oh, you again?" after failed trade attempts
- AI teams should be aware of contract lengths and the implications thereof

FEATURES
--------
injuries
opponent GM trade AI based on their team's status: contending or rebuilding
change prices of tickets, concessions, etc
hire coaches to influence development
different sized cities with differently passionate fanbases - affects attendance and home court advantage
multi-team trades... how can i make a good UI for that?
advanced stats (+/-, PER, etc)
punishment for going in debt: if cash is less than $10M, can't sign any new contracts
advisors
trades
- draft picks
- cash
- drop players as part of trade, to free up roster space
