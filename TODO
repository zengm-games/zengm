schedule failing to generate in large league https://discord.com/channels/@me/994804438919295057/1087152130638483526
- based on https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicidob/bbgm/master/cbb_roster_2019.json
- somehow related to numGames, it works with higher numbers (like 36) but not with lower numbers (like 12)
  - for lower numbers (down to 1) seems to work with odd numbers but not even numbers
  - for odd number, it seems to work on 1st try. for odd numbers, it has to search, and seems to work better for high numbers
  - this happens because for even number of teams, it wants to make home=away for all teams, while for odd it knows it can be off by one. that off by one gives it wiggle room when balancing home/away. without that wiggle room, the algorithm searches for one existing game it can swap home/away of and still be valid. but with a small number of games, it may be fairly unlikely you'll find one you can swap
    - not easy to fix... would have to better pick home/away games so this doens't happen in the first place (rather than random) or allow a chain of swaps rather than one swap to fix it

On Free Agents page, for players asking for more than my available cap space, add somewhere (maybe in the "asking for" column?) the amount of cap space I have to get rid to sign this player so I don't have to do the maths by myself https://discord.com/channels/290013534023057409/331882115119448065/979755636529168404
- should be in another column, hidden by default

League Finances page always shows the current  salary cap/ min payroll/luxury tax limit even when you go back in time - I'd rather have it display values from the past years (or also could be shown in roster page - previous years) https://discord.com/channels/290013534023057409/331882115119448065/979759314090754108

minors
- add "type" property to stats row, could be playoffs, minors, or undefind (regular season)
  - or, add a "minors" flag?
  - same idea for regularSeason and playoffs flags in playersPlus
- configurable # of slots. default 0
- at the end of every day, assemble random teams of players in the minors and sim minors games
  - always keep same (pro) team together?
  - position balance needed for hockey/football?
- should minors lead to improvement? make it configurable, but default no
- need anything special with contracts?

hockey ovr revamp
- ovrs for skater and goalie. determine skater positions like BBGM, including possibility of hybrid positions like F. cause there's really a fair amount of overlap in what players do

more season preview stuff
- top free agent signings
- ...1 more needed
  - top young players? kind of redundant

for some fbgm penalties, don't allow the ball carrier to be called

soccer-style team names
- implementation
  - add two field allongside abbrev/region/name - customMedium and customLong
    - customMedium is a medium length name. if undefined, Region is used. could be defined to disambiguate two teams in the same reason, like "LA Earthquakes" and "LA Lowriders"
      - already manually using LA Lowriders in achievements.ts
    - customLong is a long name. if undefined, Region Name is used. could be defined to have european-style team names
  - ...this still results in weird situations, like not knowing how to use the medium name in a sentence since it might be the city or it might be the team name, like is it plural or not?
- usually process in UI. maybe will need some in worker, like for notifications
- add to teamsPlus?
- @Ra98

getCopy/getCopies dry
- rename to idb.get/idb.getAll
- share code
- any place that uses this conditionally vs cache.get/getAll, use just getCopy and make sure it's no slower
  - lookup of single primary key (such as season or xid) should look in cache first and short circuit if found there

fbgm edge cases
- half the distance to the goal should also happen for offensive penalties, except pass interference https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgzGllMLKdrcDDZTrvJDDlgkNBFTl

customizable columns https://discord.com/channels/@me/914986660020748321
- figure out how to deal with per game vs total vs per 36 in BBGM - currently can't display together
- define "standard" columns available in some context (like "career total" or "individual season")
- deal with instability in the current column selection system - like if # of columns changes (sometimes due to season change), selection gets lost
- start gradually porting over some views

dropbox integration - save league to cloud

- make spotOfEnforcementIndexes and cleanHandsChangeOfPossessionIndexes dynamic when computing penalties, like possessionChangeIndexes
- option to apply penalty on kickoff, for extra points
- option to redo punt or not

the better way to make FA more detailed but still simple would be to replace the "Sign" button with a "bid" button. And have FAs only take deals after you simulate forward a day. Allow teams to make deals that are +5 or +10 or +15% larger or smaller in the negotiate page, to make their chances of the FA signing with them better/worse. The get rid of the "player won't sign with you" thing. Just show a "chance of signing" given a certain size of deal https://discord.com/channels/290013534023057409/331882115119448065/846534950101843969

- support adding custom awards
- support editing seasons older than the start of the league

UI for selecting a custom set of teams in a new league
- DOES THIS MAKE SENSE?
  - random players - sure, it's fine
  - real players, league file - gets a bit tricky for leagues starting after preseason, due to needing to match up tid/cid/did with various other objects, such as playoffSeries, scheduledEvents, teamSeason, etc
- after MVP
  - do we think of it as "editing the teams list of in some league file" or "specifying teams list, which may include additional info like adding real teams"? the latter is simpler, because then we start a league with no history or anything. but in UI terms it's unclear how to present it... like the "Customize" button is great for a random players league, because it already has no history or anything. but should that include access to real players? and how should the "main" flow be for accessing real players, should it be only from the "custom league" screen? if it's hidden in another dropdown, probably not many people would see it. so i guess it'd just be nice from a UI perspective if it could be made generic enough to work everywhere, but i don't know if that will be possible.
    - to work everywhere, needs to keep disabled teams too
- "Customize" link in "Pick your team", maybe next to "Random". that results in a list of custom teams+options in state, which is reset whenever you switch the season/phase for real players, or switch the customize setting on the right
  - does this make sense? what if we do a real players league and pick 2 custom teams with random players, what would that imply?
    - i guess that's fine... real players would be generated from the team configuration, and if there are none, there are none. all other settings from that real season would still apply
- clicking "Customize" takes you to a new page
  - list of teams by confs/divs

  - Save/Cancel buttons at the bottom
    - rewrite cids/dids/tids to be continuous on save
      - for tids need to be careful - tid is referenced in other parts of a league file, most importantly players, but also other parts. so maybe don't allow this from uploaded files?
        - if allow, store a map of (old file tid -> new league tid) and use it to update/delete all team-related objects
          - i guess same would be needed for cid/did
        - see makeTIDsSequential
      - need to be careful for cids too, see PlayoffSeriesTeam
        - even if we don't keep any history, need to consider in-progress playoffs
- for storing new NewLeague, keep separate from "normal" list of teams. show customize button in red (or something) when customized. when switching settings (like random to real, or season within real) keep customized teams.
- for real players leagues, make sure scheduled events are correct (delete any referring to teams that aren't there, and make sure tids are correct especially for expansion teams)
- appending season/index to player's name
  - track how many of each slug/season are in the league file. if a slug appears more than once, add just the season (or DP or the draft year, for draft prospects) to his last name if that season appears only once. otherwise, add an index number(like #1, #2, and #3 for 3 versions of the same player from the same season), including the season too if there's also more than one season (like 2018 #2)
  - how should this deal with mixing a legends team into a real league? legends already have season appended. could save that appending until post-processing, and just always make sure to add it for legends teams (whether in legends or normal leagues)
- what about players from a league file (uploaded or real players) that are not on any defind team? delete? make free agents?
- would be nice if the Customize Teams page was a new URL so the back button worked the same as "cancel"
  - will have same issue when adding a settings page

  - Want to create a league where the Eastern Conference is made up of all the real Atlanta teams from the 80s, and the Western Conference is made up of all the real Sacramento teams from the 90s, and have it start in 1962 and proceed with real players in the draft from there? I don't know why you'd want to do that, but you can do that.

ability to switch back to prior year
- In danger zone, button to reset to preseason of any season
  - preseason, or regular season? or pick phase?
- On export league, ability to export at any past preseason
- would need to store rosters each preseason, similar to groundhog day
  - new object store, primary key season, array of all roster infos?
    - do i ever want to suppport different phases? then primary key needs to be (season, phase)
    - delete old data
    - league export
    - league creation
  - write at the end of newPhase that switches to this season+phase?
- available seasons/phases populate the menu by looking at the keys of the object store
- also roll back teams, somehow
- roll back g changes, when possible
  - maybe store g in the object store too... { g, teams }
- g.repeatSeason could become a boolean that uses this (eventually, gotta worry about upgrades)
- maybe not...
  - in other games, this would be achieved by saving at different times. when that is easier (stream) that will be better
  - storing g is messy, since g already has a history mechanism

typescript 4.1 stuff

nicidob new ovr formula
- basketball: https://github.com/zengm-games/zengm/pull/275/files
  - see new-ovr branch
- football: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/H5pPmb3r6J/
  - nicodob says:
    - as I said I rewrote this code (b/c I'm doing the testing on a different computer) and the PR uses .csv exports but this version uses .json leagues. https://github.com/nicidob/fbgm/blob/master/ratings.ipynb
    - that does the ratings and vomits out the over_under roster
    - as-is it basically eats FBGM or BBGM leagues up. It does the position-specific code. So to replicate the PR I just replace the pos = r['pos'] with pos='ALL' and the code is happy to do it
    - yeah I mean there's a handful of differences here. this uses JSON leagues (not a split 'avg.csv'/'game.csv'), and does position-specific breakdowns. But yes it's the same thing, it takes leagues with box scores and does minute-weighted rating differences to MOV for individual games
    - it also doesn't do the scaling to ensure the mean and variance are unchanged (i just check R^2 and move on)
    - And here I'm using L1 Regularization + Cross-Validation to drop a bunch of coefficients to zero for ratings that don't matter
    - the problem is i got really wonky distributions when I tried to output the FBGM stuff
    - like I don't understand how mean/variance are set by the code right now
    - the notebook spits out a copy+paste table for ovr.football.ts and I have a local copy with it but the numbers are big and positions are set - wrong because I deleted bonuses and.....
    - it was non-obvious to me how to get these in-game in a good way so I don't have a good PR

FBGM too many very short players

fuzz
- nicidob - fix fuzz uniformity so that it's more like 70 +/- 1, 60 +/- 3,  50 +/-5

more variation in pace plz @nicidob

how to stop 2p from beign a negative rating
- @nicidob says: basic summary: it's used only in "usage", but it's a small part of that, and "shoot midrange". Well... shoot midrange is like 0.8 to 0.9 PPS, while Dunks and 3s are 1.2 and 1.1 PPS. Sure, actual ratings shift the %s, but i'm not sure how extreme it'd have to get before your MR PPS isn't the "worst possible shot". So the 2p setting basically is "how likely are you to take the worst possible shot". My idea is to make the mid-range more of a "leftover"... if your 3p or dunk or LP isn't high enough, it gets picked. then higher 2p is just higher MR accuracy and its negative effect is gone. Then you can era-adjust the default

break difficulty setting into multiple components that can be controlled independently

option to disable the cap entirely. Turn the Hard Cap option into "Cap Type" with "None, Soft Cap, Hard Cap". leave the setting for actual salary cap, so it can be used for all the contract computation. @nicidob

possible to enter into negotiations with a player, trade away other players so that now he refuses to negotiate, but still sign him because negotiations have already started
- check mood on negotiation page, even if negotiation already started

when I just deleted old data, processing after draft and pre season sped up atleast 200%

trade balancing
- https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/jhtm1k/im_playing_charlotte_queens_on_hard_mode_and_i/
- could value DPs and players before first progs more
- I don’t think it’s something intended to happen, pretty frequently if I trading block a late first round pick I get offers for guys drafted ahead of my pick
- care more about bad contracts
- FBGM should not demand as much in 2 for 1 trades? https://discord.com/channels/@me/696164463312764949/776342790586105877

profit for extreme caps needs to be fixed first, its not possible to make money above $400m cap space

built-in UI to load custom user files
- UI in BBGM to create league
  - api to list league files
  - page in BBGM to list the league files, with links that go to the new league form pre-populated with that URL for a league file
- limit users who can upload
  - gwood
- database table to store metadata
  - id
  - user_id
  - sport
  - name
  - description
  - num_leagues_created
  - last_updated
  - version (increment every update, keep in URL)
- CRUD UI for people to upload/edit/delete league files

gradually reveal progs mode
- displayed ratings are f(t, current ratings, last year's ratings)
  - after like half the season, always just current ratings. prior to that, depends on phase and games played
  - reveal with some polynomial, like x^n, so it's not predictable if a small increase will lead to a big increase later

DataTable
- places to use sortValue (implemented) and searchValue (not implemented yet):
  - ImportPlayers inputs
  - Height/Weight in PlayerBios needs searchValue
  - NegotiateButtons (search for negotiate/refuses)
  - sorting by skills on draft history
  - would allow sorting by checked/unchecked for trade and trading block
  - get rid of awkward children stuff - PlayerNameLabels, mood, ...
    - then get rid of react-addons-text-content

allow user to cancel relocation if it's their team?
- what about contraction, what would that imply for future events?

contract formatting https://old.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/hotbbw/small_readability_issue_inconsistent_decimals_on/
- always show 2 decimal places?
- right align, and use tabular-nums so numbers are aligned?

The spending page needs to fixed. Either change the "finances" so you select "spending rank" (1st thru 30th) or make the finance system actually use cardinal values. right now it's confusing for new players and kinda annoying to set yourself as first the in the league (guess + check)

import/export players
- maybe
  - export
    - table alignment
      - skills and button are a little too big
  - import
    - checkbox to keep or delete history (stats, ratings, awards, HoF)
    - add import to event log? for individual player, or aggregate?

more realistic free agents when generating league
- look at retired young players from previous season

customizable columns in datatable
- future
  - SortableTable
  - supercols
    - change input format to be associated with these index numbers, then can derive which should be shown and where
    - or, change cols input to include flag for which supercol a col belongs to
    - but for MVP, no customization of supercols tables
  - always return all stats and ratings?

from survey
- people really like looking back at history
- people really want better playing time control
- player comparison should be better
  - https://bbgm6man.eiphi.eu/
- team comparison should be better
- better international name options
- player mood revamp (bigger contract, ring-chasing, etc)

fuzz/scouting revamp
- prospects and young players only
- fuzz is deterministic noise
- scouting budget affects accuracy of mood percentages?

FBGM
- in FBGM, tags aren't generated for custom roster's draft classes until the end of the season.
- rosters https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicidob/bbgm/master/fbgm_roster_2019_sss.json
- some OL stat
- increase value of K/P so they won't be traded for nothing
  - user report of K/P being released by AI teams during season! AI teams should take roster construction into account here
  - @geonerd#6946
- smarter cutting when over roster limit (like don't cut only K/P)
- easier position changes, maybe from roster or player pages
  - auto sort roster after? or maybe have option to set if user controls roster sort or not
    - default should be "not"
- Add the release and trade away buttons to the depth chart screen. I find myself flipping back and forth from the depth chart and roster.
- Add the roster composition to any roster type screen like draft, depth chart, and trade screens.
- trade possible after playoffs phase begins, but only before first playoff game is played?
- weird offensive holding application https://old.reddit.com/r/Football_GM/comments/i33wix/penalties_wonky/g1073zl/?context=3
- DL in FBGM get way too many interceptions, CB should get more
- in FBGM, during the FA period with 30 days: injured players on rosters will not recover a single week if you sim to 1 day left in FA; injured players in fa will recover a week in every day of FA (30 weeks total)
- in OT, if the other team has already scored a FG, never punt!!!
- better support for running QBs to put up big numbers

- had a playoff game go to double overtime. with two minutes left in the first OT, I saw a score pop up on the scoring summary saying someone had kicked a field goal. that did not actually happen in-game. instead, the game went to the second overtime, where that field goal did in fact happen with two minutes to play. so basically, in double overtime games, the scoring summary updates scores for the second overtime at the times they happened, but in the first OT instead. first OT (field goal was not kicked, but the scoring summary updated anyways)

eventually
- what happens to scheduled event if the user changes something relevant to it prior to the event happening? does this matter?
- show draft prospects separately when creating a new custom league, to allow creating one without them

redo trade system
- make it so that teams are less likely to trade for players when there is a better/ slightly worse player in FA for around the same price. people exploit that all the time
- some factor based on # of recent trades (similar to player mood revamp?)
- value of picks should depend of draftType setting

team needs/synergy display on roster
- and power rankings

---

BAA teams should enter with intact rosters, not expansion draft

relocation fun stuff
- would be cool to let people cancel a relocation of their team
  - could prompt them, and then if they say no still move their cid/did but leave the rest alone

fuzz doesn't really make sense
- have it decrease as a player plays. so high only for draft prospects or unknowns

better trade finder AI
- handle salary matching constraint
- use in trading block, and betweenAiTeams
- after doing this
  - make sure big trades happen enough in betweenAiTeams - see random.choice weights in betweenAiTeams
  - also make sure betweenAiTeams doens't accept really bad trades, see dv2 check
    - especially for minor trades, not sure if dv as an absolute value rather than % makes sense

- draft picks owned, and rank of team
- top draft prospects

events revamp
- eventually
  - nothing should be lost, ever
  - store info about trade, so the summary of a trade can be linked to
    - for traded picks, store info so eventual picked players can be filled in later
  - like trade above... all events should not have premade text, but instead have the metadata to generate it. then can do things like including RatingsStatsPopover
  - in playoffs, recovery should only be notable if the team is still alive
  - include all time records being broken, like career scoring, etc
  - merge some together
    - expansion draft teams in one event
    - contraction teams in one event

support changing team logos at any season, from predefined real team logos
- future
  - handle if the user edits something but realTeamInfo specifies an override
    - could check if the pre-overridden value is the previous override or not
    - could add a flag to track if a field has been edited or not
    - neiether of those is perfect
  - make player photo overrides dynamic too?

  - console.log(document.cookie) - he says this returns an empty string, so i guess the cookie isn't being set somehow
    - would explain things, if cookie was not being set somehow. but should also be checked on account.basketball-gm.com directly

add toggle to table, to turn it into a heatmap showing which values are high or low. like think on a player stats table

make the 3 year delayed effect of team finances more obvious

teams play better/worse when down/up

- deltas for ratings at the top
- highlight ratings based on comparison to position average (maybe like popover)

@nicidob Add an option to float the salary cap. Have it come from something like Sum(hype * population). So if NY/LA/CHI/MXC have bad teams, it's worse! Maybe even have hype depend on team rating (so if the whole league is playing crappy teams then the cap goes down).

- sport specific options, like shot tendencies, enabling/disabling 3 pointers, etc
- have them as sliders, where 50 means "no effect", 0 means "never happens", and 100 means "always". then blend those rates with the default rates behind the scenes
- maybe redo foulRateFactor this way

illness @mattable#4273
- pass to teammates or opponents

team rating
- currently for past seasons, includes traded players on both teams. so intead, store value at end of each season
  - stored value will also make power rankings simpler and faster
- show on other pages, like team history
- team potential rating?
- somehow show everywhere, like how RatingsStatsPopover is for players
- change scale, make it harder to get 100?
  - but also don't make there be no variation in default leagues. maybe make it nonlinear 90+

- population growth
- inflation of other revenue/expenses
- make them constant, or from a random distribution?

some gamesim issues
- https://old.reddit.com/message/messages/ne69ad
- too many safeties

Can DL get more sacks and TFLs in FBGM? Tackle numbers on the DL are realistic now, so adding more sacks and TFLs would make it more realistic. Actually lower TFLs. There's several guys with more than 20 TFLs in my league. @☭☭#9825

blocked fg too uncommon?

Just started playing the other day and it's pretty fun! A lot different than BBGM but the roster management is fun even if the games can feel kind of random. Few things stood out. Not sure if this is just for balance purposes, but teams are WAY stricter about giving up next year's 1st round picks than in real life. I can package 3 amazing players and the best I get offered is a 1st 4 years in the future. Meanwhile IRL 1st rounders get traded for much less (Cooper for a 1st straight up).

Also I wonder if there is a way to present a player's value in regards to the position they play. What I mean is if I want to draft a good RB in the game I have to invest an early pick, but in the NFL teams find starting RBs day 3 on a pretty regular basis (although the argument there is OL is more important for the run game than the RB) so that might actually be pretty complicated to implement.

Finally I saw dumbmatter mention this in the initial post, but there really should be guaranteed rookie contracts. They are basically standard in the NFL and I don't see why a simulation wouldn't mirror this. Just feels weird all my players only want 2 year contracts when they are usually stuck with the team for 4 years at least. Just some initial thoughts, great work overall!

keyStats for OL should not show tiny # of tackles

rookie contracts too high still?

situationally aware play calling
- pass or run, hurry up or milk the clock with lead
- kneeling to run out clock
- clocking ball to stop clock
- hail mary as a separate play type?
  - needTouchdown

Also I just had my rookie QB get onto the All-Rookie Team in the QB slot, but he was also slotted in as an All-Rookie punter, without having done any punts all season.

stat distribution pages

too many players playing both offense and defense
- reassess after making roster construction better. if it's still a problem, only allow starter at one position
- too many fat guys with elite speed, small guys with elite strength?

weight formula is not very good

redo pot formulas?

---

Add "All Seasons" option to various stat/ratings pages
- Player Ratings
- Team Stats

injury later
- injury history leads to chance of reinjury
- height influences injury probability (see same paper as age)
- career ending injuries

can i get SideBar to have open state simply passed to it? performance might be ok now

why is free agency so slow?

button on free agents screen to fill out roster with players making up to 2x the minimum

exportPlayerGamesCsv only supports basketball currently, and it's disabled in ExportStats.js. football box scores are more complicated, more derived stats

way to specify routes for ShotLocations/RosterContinuity/Depth, so they aren't included in football/basketball routes

game sim
- pick playType from (down, toGo, scrimmage, score, quarter, time)
- later
  - clock
    - pace
    - clock management, strategy
  - for 2 point conversions and extra points, penalties don't actually move scrimmage currently!
  - log clutch plays
  - blocked fg
    - count as missed field goal
    - chance for either team to return (very slim for offense)
  - blocked punt
  - missed fg/xp return

AV advanced stat
- OL and defense
  - in individualPts, check if they actually seem to apply (no substantial rushing/receiving/passing stats)

how to get types working, options:
- make anything depending on an override or sport-sepcific type into a factory function or generic, initialized in deionWorker or deionUI and then passed around
- pass around overrides manually everywhere, not making it a module
- move everything inside deion

type better
- skills/compositeRatings - should be RatingsKey, not string for components. And PlayerRatings
- PlayerStatType should be sport specific
- getCopy/getCopies and Cache
  - awards should return Awards
  - players and playersPlus - Player<> and Player<MinimalPlayerRatings> should be Player<PlayerRatings>
- most MinimalPlayerRatings uses should be generic and take PlayerRatings

split more from deion
- processInputs for views only in one sport (depth, shot locations)
- worker API functions only in one sport (depth)

contract demands and position assignments should be based on which position maximizes p.value, not which position maximizes ovr. would you rather have an 80 ovr qb or a 100 ovr kicker?

RatingsOverview - could put in deion, with config to specify categories and names from getCols
- RatingsForm has this already! re-use

---

on import, error if any player/draftPick references an invalid tid

during free agency, after you sign all your free agents it should automatically take you to the league free agents and skip the step of having to continue

if a trade is highly unfavorable to the user, pop up a warning confirmation dialog

live game
- field with drive summary, football, direction, and last play

---

in table, sort position by constants.POSITIONS order (like roster page in football)

everywhere contract is displayed, make it in italics if not guaranteed
- currently only on roster i think. make a component!

"Accept Trade" button on trading block

AI teams should adjust finances

https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/app-install-banners/

after preseason, after player development, recalculate player value
- use ovr vs PER formula, but with offset based on prior value

Don't allow play if versions in tabs don't match
- close worker?

---

React.StrictMode

to send notification to correct screen, need `conditions` in views/allStars (and other getOrCreate calls). should be possible right? yeah, could request hostID from shared worker, and then sent it to runBefore functions, but... is it worth it? maybe not

BoxScoreRow
- link to team should be for the season of the ASG, not current season always (in boxScore.season but not passed to Row)
- highlight user team abbrev

Difficulty fudge factor should only be for user team (finances, trades)
- for trades this is hard because valueChange does not know if it's the user's team or not, need to accept another parameter

make AI smarter about contracts
- then do cool shit, like a tunable "randomness" factor or something that lets you tune player development, and also overall talent level, and also distribution of different ratings (to sim different eras)
  - https://www.google.com/search?q=OOTP+player+generator+modifiers&client=ubuntu&hs=nzO&channel=fs&sxsrf=ALeKk03DAwxNZl2Io6A0PwDmnR3InA95_w:1612847896152&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjc07TPhtzuAhXlUd8KHdfaB9kQ_AUoAnoECA8QBA&biw=1920&bih=869#imgrc=qKcVVE7ByPY6xM

index updating
- currenty: check if the indexed property has changed, and only update a specific index then
- would be better: make _dirtyIndexes per index, not per store  
- even better: incrementally update index

later
- in new league: set rookie contracts appropriately
- in new league: initialize rebuilding/contending to non-random values
- don't include core.debug in prod builds?
- steeper penalties for unbalanced lineups
  - increasing perimfactor not enough - need to reevaluate formula. see all_bigs.json
    - perimfactor shouldn't be needed. just use the synergy stuff. should be offense and defense. check values for normal and extreme teams
- simulate draft from past seasons, to correctly assign contracts (don't need to populate actual draft info)

NEED TO FIX TRADE AI
- make tests of trades that should/shouldn't happen
- example: should never offer a strictly worse pick for a better pick. or at least not commonly

no POT mode, to make it harder

persist fantasy draft results
- make an array of draft results
- viewable somehow - need to track when fantasy drafts happened and add them to draft results menu

career totals on player pages https://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/7ya1yu/any_more_thoughts_on_the_beta/duptp08/?context=3

open multiple leagues from dashboard at the same time - Invalid cache status "filling"
- looks like flush is being called while status is "filling", can that be short circuited since idb.cache has been redefined? lid is different, or the hostID is different?
  - happens because it calls "flush" when closing an existing open database. should be more explicit about state of loading (no league loaded or loading, league X loaded and no league loading, league X loaded and league Y loading, no league loaded and league Y loading)
  - then will also need a way to prevent UI errors, if a UI update function is running and expects e.g. g to be populated but it's not - UI should check the aforementioned state as well and wait for loaded

reevaluate FA system - too easy to rebuild
- too many young stars available
- first pick at most players

somehow display synergy, maybe on roster page

watch list players should result in notifications when things happen (FA salary drops, trades, signings, release, retire)
- https://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/7h3eqy/simple_feature_request/

advanced team stats
- strength of schedule: https://www.pro-football-reference.com/blog/index9e6d.html?p=37&cpage=1
  - to set up this system of equations, need to know the schedule, but that is not stored anywhere currently. need to persist original schedule. maybe only soft delete games as they are played, or copy to another table?
  - use https://www.npmjs.com/package/linear-solve to solve
- team ortg/drtg/nrtg adjusted for strength of schedule

advanced stat table too confusing? needs vertical dividers/spacing?

use something besides PER in player value formula

per 100 possessions and totals toggle on team stats page

remove polyfills

add franchise leaders (stats) to team history page

marker for feats from the playoffs/finals https://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/6gpf1f/suggestion_a_marker_of_some_sort_next_to_game/

AI trades
- notification? only for big trades. quantify! maybe show that info in transactions page too

colors
- color ratings on ratings page (and tables), just like ratings popup
- color stats in ratings popover

force single tab per league
- when < 5 seconds, wait for another heartbeat before deciding
- check for collission in setInterval, and somehow show error page if that happens

shared worker
- namespace stuff, after it's working for one league
  - attach lid to promiseWorker instance in host (call it "metadata"), update lid if it changes, and attach to every request from host
    - then from worker, pass into toUI
  - query API: flag to determine if broadcast or single response. default single response. optional last arg, so single response use case is same API as now
    - if broadcast, then response is always undefined
    - broadcast needs to be namespaced, too. like only "update all league 5" not "update all tabs open in every league"
      - figure out some way to abstract... like maybe a conditional broadcast function defined based on metadata
  - namespace leagues (or force only one league)
    - namespace locks, g (in worker only), idb.league, and idb.cache
    - all common functions, accept g as param
    - something to handle init/close of tabs
    - look at all toUI calls
  - disconnect league when none are left registered to promise worker (so need api to get all metadata)
  - this would help with exhibition games too

when dirty on close, show warning window, and initiate flush (if not already in progress)
- hard to coordinate across UI and worker...

this shit is UGLY UGLY UGLY, fix ASAP!!!
  if (typeof it === "function") { return; }

get tests working
- db.getCopy.teams
  - operate on individual functions? can export them just for tests
  - confirm operations that don't require IDB
  - confirm getAll updates from cache

document cache data format and API!
- different things are cached, depending on object store
- all modifications go into cache
- cache mutations are dangerous, see getCopy
- read from just the cache if you're sure everything is there (like an active player). otherwise, read from db and augment with cache (because anything could be in cache, even if it's not normally.. like retired player added to watch list). getCopy variables do this

----

situational awareness
- possession length
  - ? timeouts to advance ball (shorter possession) or make subs
  - ? shot clock violation
- fouls
  - ? sometimes foul when up 3 and not much time left
  - ? hack a shaq
- rotations
  - ? sub in good FT shooters in late game situations

    rewrite gamesim, fixing all these problems? also, coaching less agressively when game is blowout, playing stars more in important games, ...
    tricky: good teams have high skill players, who are going to do really well in any synergy metric. so it's hard to punish unbalanced teams through synergy without decreasing parity by a lot
      hacky approach: stay with something similar to current system, but with an extra penalty for very unbalanced teams (could be sigmoidal so it only affects really poorly balanced teams)

old players are currently undervalued

http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2v26p1/how_are_you_exploiting_the_trade_ai/
IMPORTANT http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/20i6v3/still_too_easy_to_trade_for_drafted_players/
  just drafted players are undervalued, possibly related to the following issue
second round draft picks are undervalued. also, giving away a pick should never make a trade worse, but sometimes it does now. http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2bg3zx/simple_feature_mark_players_as_offlimits_when_we/cj5ap89
  similarly, trading block for nothing can net you second round picks
trade for tons of cheap second round picks, then use that to trade for good asset: www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/27wjnp/33_pennies_for_a_dollar/
release and resign pick exploit http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1zn61h/finances/cfvzr35\
some limit on trades so people can't make 1000 slightly beneficial trades: http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1zzwbs/suggestions_on_trades/cg0e0dg
  probably make opposing owners less likely to trade as the number of proposed trades increases in a season
Eventually:
  "What would make this work?" functions should know about contending/rebuilding. Contending teams should be more eager to offer up young/cheap players, rebuilding teams should be more eager to offer up old/expensive players
    basically, they should view the trade from the other team's perspective, not just their own
  Can I provide better feedback about trade? Like if it's close or not? Or if it's rejected because of cap space issues?
  Set params with optimization algorithm
  Fix needToDrop stuff
    Problem now is, contract gets pushed into someone on the roster and it's lost. This is especially obvious if there is only one player in add and his contract is pushed to roster, then the trade is nothing.
    Probably not that important, since teams almost always have shitty players at the end of their rosters
  EXPLOIT that might be tricky to solve: in the "resigning players" phase, your free agents should still count towards your cap. Otherwise, you can trade to take on salary and then sign your players over the cap
  Should draft pick contract "worth" be determined better somehow, like it is for normal contracts? probably yes
    does this allow removal of fudge factor?
  population (i.e. richness) should influence opinion of contracts

notification system
  customize: http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1re3ea/new_feature_notification_bubbles/cdmjdyn
  what about for small screens? maybe just show one at a time. is this actually a problem?
  also log these events:
    fired - log, but don't show
    new team
  notify
    when something happens to a player on the watch list
    big AI moves - trades, free agent signings
  merge "retired" and "HOF" notifications for a player on the user's team
  important notifications should be a different color, maybe require acknowledgement before closing
    errors
    refuse to sign
    retire

BIG NEW FEATURES
----------------

player stat summaries http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2bf4z0/functionality_of_the_game_vs_2k/cj5ir16
display of relative ratings like https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/144a4a04330edf3d
trade improvements
  refactor trade module with all the below in mind
    clean up even more?
      should create and updatePlayers be merged? updatePlayers already updates tids too
      either way, they should take partial objects and fill in the default/existing values
  trade suggestions (and trading block) should know salary rules
    HOW?
    team.valueChange could be made fast if I allow an extra argument to pass pre-fetched values from the database
    quick fix: check box to only look for teams under the cap http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1qh107/proposed_trades_question/
  trades between AI teams
    call team.checkRosterSizes after this if it's in between days
team switching after being fired
  keep track of what team the user controlled, so stats for the user (not the team) can be shown
random events
  like.. player gets suspended, out X games. or player gets into fight, fan support drops. etc.
more detailed draft - slower picks, trades, etc.
  slower picks http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1r70dv/trade_picks_during_draft
  sort by generic value (current) or team-specific value
  trade picks - note that the code in teamValue will need to be modified to account for the lottery and available players in the draft class
contests: post roster file and goal

BIG NEW GAMEPLAY CHANGES
------------------------

Extended free agency
  order of AI team signings shouldn't be linear
  0 year contracts http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1p0sa8/new_feature_extended_free_agency/ccy4gvp
  AI teams can release players to sign a better free agent?
fix contracts, signing
  goal: reasonable total payrolls, no good free agents left every season
  if WS distribution matches NBA, then look at $ vs WS. even better, build a multivariate model with age
  contracts should take ratings into more account, since stats on a good team are inflated and stats on a bad team are depressed
  player contract amounts http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1kj0p0/can_i_turn_off_firing/cbpxjyj?context=3
gameSim
  mediocre three point shooters should shoot it less http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2bwvpj/psa_players_who_shouldnt_shoot_3s_continue_to/
  smart substitutions http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2b9w78/went_7012_with_this_roster_is_this_really_that/cj3zgui
  big men should score more, shoot more FTs http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2amqpo/how_come_all_of_the_top_scorers_are_always_3_guys/
  pos/neg effects add on like civ4 defensive bonuses?
  balance http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1jfcjw/game_imbalance_fc_with_rdi/ http://www.reddit.com/message/messages/1097mj
  http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1j1e6q/i_made_a_singleplayer_basketball_management/cbfzr43?context=3 http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1k1881/pf_stands_for_powerful/
    too easy to get high percentage inside looks even with a team of all bigs?
    or should some of the "bigs" really be smalls, just mislabeled as PFs?
  make it less easy to get high percentage shots if there is no ball handling
    tweak perimFactor and synergyFactor.
  increase turnovers, particularly if perimFactor (or similar) is low
  increase fouls if perimFactor (or similar) is low
  assists should be function of speed, since those players have the ball more
  situational awareness http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1yg6wi/end_of_game_simulation/
  mediocre players on bad teams should be less efficient (shouldn't put up such a high PER, which falls if they join a good team)
add free agent to the end of roster
"My Player" mode http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2swmwj/there_should_be_a_game_like_myplayer_in_2k/cntkvj4

MINOR FIXES
-----------

documentation
  http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2agxoe/questions_and_suggestions_from_a_new_player/
Add MVP and Titles columns to HoF table
on team history, show counts of conf/league championships, hall of fame players, etc
if a player refuses to resign, that decision should also be reflected in free agency (don't recalculate mood)
add "drb" to usage so that good ball handlers shoot more (favor guards over bigs more)
in player page, show red/green for ratings changes from the previous year, maybe as heatmap
in ratings tables, show dpot and dovr columns? maybe?
replace random.gauss with random.realGauss
don't need to check every team's roster limits every time games are played - could auto keep AI teams in line after any trade (with user or between AI teams), and then only the user's team needs to be checked

LOW PRIORITY
------------

track longest W/L streaks
team chemistry http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/2oco2a/simple_suggestion_team_chemistry/cmrpap6?context=3
box plots / distributions
  "it'd be great to overlay your roster to see where you stand. Maybe click on a name in a list to add or remove it from the display. Do I have a fast team? Do I have a three point shooting team? Are we big and bruising and slow?"
compare players http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1saclf/suggestion_compare_players/
fantasy draft
  when fantasy draft is over, go to summary of the draft
    do this in core.draft.untilUserOrEnd
  add entry for fantasy draft summary to draft history dropdown?
some kind of playoff series overview page, including box scores for easy access
A year-to-date comparison of team finances with the previous year.
dashboard info should be on a widget accessible from any screen
player search page
  show stats, ratings, contract, etc. (customizable); allow filters to be applied. also filter by skill icon
  search by stats, ratings, or attributes
  trade for button, or sign button if free agent, or draft button if draft prospect
    same contextual buttons for watch list
    can this become main UI for drafting (at least fantasy draft)
finances
  too easy to make big $$$
    owner should take profits each year
  AI teams should adjust spending
harsher, more realistic luxury tax
midlevel exception
more refined control of playing time
  http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1j1e6q/i_made_a_singleplayer_basketball_management/cbaegpq
  http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1qaml8/playing_time_explain_to_me_like_im_8/
  just set minutes directly? any minutes not included, leave up to coach's discretion
trades
  cash
    estimate value of cash - different for different teams? depending on cash, net profit recently, and market size
    upper limit? what is NBA rule?
  more feedback from AI
    if trade is close/far from working, return different messages
    display some indication of what a team wants to do on the trade view, e.g.
      "I need to cut my payroll and start making more money."
      "I could really use a good rebounder."
  sign and trade (only during resigning phase)
export/import roster
  some way to specify startingSeason
  easily edit in excel?
increase hype for big free agent signings
how to handle aggregating stats for players who played for more than one team in a season? add them all up in ps in db.getPlayers
  for roster, want just a player's stats with this team this season
    this currently works, just pass a tid
  for player stats view, want total among all teams for one season
    no pass tid and you only get the latest row. need added logic to do sum
  for player view, want separate and combined rows in careerStats without fucking up totals (including PER)
    no pass tid and you get each team separately, but no merged stats as above
if fouling out drops team below 5 active players, play fouled out players but add a FT each foul (technical)
show old contracts on old roster view
core.trade refactoring
  validateSavedTids crap should be in trade.js.
  trade.summary stuff should be automatic and stored in tradeStore
  trade and clear buttons should be disabled during gameSim, with message like in team finances
final score, hall of fame
  influenced by size of city (see: difficulty in views.newLeague)
AI modules that contain functions which are called to determine actions
  things to regulate...
    draft picks
    signing free agents
    resigning players
    trades
    budget items (like from team finances view)
    releasing/buying out players when over limit
some UI showing the state of the team's synergy. maybe like an advisors screen that suggests what kind of player is needed to improve synergy
  also can respond to budget changes
  more general: have "media" reporting things like 10 worst contracts, etc
like on team finances page, anywhere else to add help popups?
  should this be abstracted rather than just inline in views?
  inline anything from the manual?
AI updating of *Budgets and ticket prices
  maybe not necessary at this stage?
  call core.finances.updateBudgetRanks() after
update formulas
  nationalTvRevenue
    same for each team, change contract year by year and display in team finances
  localTvRevenue
    eventually, t.seasons[0].tvContract

@TheRealGWood#4891 Team traits
  Have you ever played CK2?
  I ask because the more comments I see like that reddit post the more simple I think replacing Mood with traits would work. 
  CK2 uses them. You can created TRID trait ID store as 1-10 or something fir starters-
  Injury prone - 10% higher injury frequency 
  Chronic injury- 20% higher injury chance, 10% higher - result from injury 
  Erratic- -5 Mood, -5 for every other erratic or Ego
  Ego- +5 mood, -10 minutes under 30 or usuage under 28%
  Demands a Trade- Won’t resign. -10 team mood 
  Team leader- +5 team mood, +1DIQ team, +1 OIQ team
  Savy Vet- better team progs, +1 team mood , unhappy if losing 
  Team player- +1 team mood
  Ball hog- -1 team mood +1 mood if usuage over 25%
  Farewell season- +3 in all traits final game and forced retire at end of season, +1 team mood
  Franchise player - (only over 70’s) max 1 per team or mood= -10, 
  Star- team mood + 0.5, savy vets more likley to sign 
  Bookworm- +3 OIQ/DIQ 
  Idiot- -3 OIQ/ DIQ , team mood -1

  Team traits-
  Deep playoff run= (CF) team mood+ 2
  Chip- team mood +1
  Got a star- team mood +2
  Has franchise player- Team mood +1
  FAiled to make playoffs ect....

  This would allow for DM to later add:
  Lazy
  Hardworking
  Workaholic

  Out of Shape 
  Prime Shape 

  Streaky 
  Consistent 

  Clutch
  Choke artist 

  And settable traits-
  Minutes restriction 
  Load management 
  Sixth man (won’t start)
  Primary ball handler 
  Primary scorer 
  Go to Shooter

FUTURE
------

event log UI
  allow filtering type with checkboxes
  what about events with no tid? they are currently not viewable
shot charts showing hot spots (red/yellow/green) based on shot location data
If you are simulating through the whole season and execute a trade while simulating, it will continue simulating even if you are over the roster limit. http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1xch01/trades_after_season/cfamo73
hire/fire different coaches with different strategies
boxplots for shot location stats, plus comparison to NBA data
import/export stuff
  online "locker" that you can sync saved games to
moving to other cities
team finances view
  compare bar graphs against league averages?
different size stadiums, building new stadiums
tv revenue as a variable
  local tv contract - $10 million
    base on tvContractAmount, tvContractExp
    will be a deal from 3 to 5 years in length
    based on...
      region population
      "hype"
      random noise
      "random event" - competition between two networks, Sports TV and The Basketball Channel
    when renegotiating and really bad, the guy pretends not to know you - "Atlanta Herons? Is that the team from the Mexican/Canadian/Arena/Indoor/Xtreme Volleyball/Soccer/Tennis/Racing/Curling/MudWrestling League?"
input to helpers.formatCurrency (and all currency in variables everywhere) should be in 1000s of dollars and then only converted to millions when displayed
AI teams should have to deal with fuzz too
live play-by-play simulation
  change of possession with no rebound/turnover?
  could fake where the shots are to display graphically
  allow the user to make substitutions in realtime
multi team trades

# BELOW IS OLD STUFF

AI (NON-GAMESIM)
----------------
AI teams release/buy out players to sign a better free agent
