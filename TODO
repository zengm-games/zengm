DB CHANGES SINCE 3.1.0
----------------------

imgURL in player root (although lacking this doesn't cause an error now, better add it to be sure)
if not present add team*Cache things to gameAttributes
  after this is handled, delete the hack in util.viewHelpers.beforeLeague
ewa in player.stats - doesn't really matter, right?

BIG NEW FEATURES
----------------

team switching after being fired
  2 year grace period in message.js, like with a new league?
  intro message from new owner, like a new league?
  rename g.gameOver
  keep track of what team the user controlled, so stats for the user (not the team) can be shown
achievements that span leagues, or milestones: http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1jb8d6/milestones/

    Add checkboxes: Randomize Rosters (only show for custom rosters), Fantasy Draft
  leaguewide draft
  randomize players on custom rosters
localization
  http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#i18n

BIG NEW GAMEPLAY CHANGES
------------------------

remove "buy out"
less weird player rating combos
  different ratings should have different potential for growth - easier to improve jumpshot than quickness
  revamp position assignment algorithm
    until a player is ~28 (whenever ratings decline starts), recalculate every year
gameSim
  balance http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1jfcjw/game_imbalance_fc_with_rdi/ http://www.reddit.com/message/messages/1097mj
  http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1j1e6q/i_made_a_singleplayer_basketball_management/cbfzr43?context=3 http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1k1881/pf_stands_for_powerful/
    too easy to get high percentage inside looks even with a team of all bigs?
    or should some of the "bigs" really be smalls, just mislabeled as PFs?
  make it less easy to get high percentage shots if there is no ball handling
    tweak perimFactor and synergyFactor.
  increase turnovers, particularly if perimFactor (or similar) is low
  increase fouls if perimFactor (or similar) is low
  better foul logic - shouldn't just have big slow shot blockers fouling out
    also, other players shouldn't get 0 fouls. make it a bit more evenly distributed
  assists should be function of speed, since those players have the ball more
  substitutions should be based on "value", not ovr
    but player.value includes potential.. so just come up with new formula
somehow, don't let the user's team sign any/all free agents they want
  http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1jrv3a/have_we_discussed_the_draft_pick_exploit_yet/
  randomize "won't negotiate with you" more?
    make genBaseMoods lower?
player development
  should be less players who go from totally raw to superstar in one year http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1l2iiy/play_development_should_be_revisited/cbv73rd

MINOR FIXES
-----------

AI teams playing with under 5 players http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1l3od6/glitch_just_had_a_cpu_team_play_a_whole_season_w/
  AI teams should never drop below 5 in regular season http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1l3od6/glitch_just_had_a_cpu_team_play_a_whole_season_w/cbvzngs
    no min roster limit in trades?
awards
  assigned based on wins added, like hof
    store EWA in database, update when PER is updated in advStats
      use in player.madeHof - problem is, EWA isn't stored for seasons prior to this change..
    formulas:
      overall: linear combination of EWA and team wins
      defensive: basically same stupid shit as now, but make sure to account for games played
  show awards count in hall of fame
player contract amounts http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1kj0p0/can_i_turn_off_firing/cbpxjyj?context=3
make it less likely that players refuse to resign with winning teams
show annual ratings changes in roster page
  green (up) or red (down) with the number ovr and pot changed, in parentheses
  then, on switch to preseason, redirect to current roster
    when viewing a url like /l/1/roster, playing until new season shouldn't move it to roster for previous year
      this happens because inputs.season gets set even though it's not present in the URL. elegant solution?
add function to delete old box scores (older than, say 5 years) to debug menu, to save space
make trade counter-offer faster by checking if no trade is possible first http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1jumc9/is_it_just_me_or_does_it_take_wayyyy_too_long_for/
better ovr formula
  regression, see what is important?
document things that affect player mood
contracts should take ratings into more account, since stats on a good team are inflated and stats on a bad team are depressed
show four factors somewhere
show attendance in box score
security
  validate any user-added content, like custom team names (both in file and through form), custom players, and league names

LOW PRIORITY
------------

team names from db
  g.teamNamesCache and g.teamRegionsCache and g.teamAbbrevsCache - update this when appropriate
  store region and name in meta so it can be shown on dashboard
    update this when changed on customize screen
  option to load from JSON file on "Edit Team Info"
  export rosters should include teams
    option to include just team names or just players
    should update popRank when custom teams are supplied
  not so simple to allow abbrevs to be changed, since they are used elsewhere for convenience - damn indexeddb and denormalization!
  make edit_team_info prettier
popRank never updates, but I don't think it matters.
different owner personalities, with different priorities
trades
  "undo" button for accidental trades
    transaction log first. put "Undo" button after message from other GM only right after a trade finishes. make sure it doesn't show up at other time
      only allow undo if dbChange hasn't changed since the transaction was logged
  too easy to trade for yougn stars: http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1j1e6q/i_made_a_singleplayer_basketball_management/cbaayir http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1k1stt/traded_a_2017_2nd_rounder_for_the_1_pick/
    maybe weight potential higher for players with no stats, or this could depend on age
  draft pick value needs to be reassessed: http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1j2mag/ive_gotten_pretty_good/cbajbz6?context=3 http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1j1e6q/i_made_a_singleplayer_basketball_management/cbb3l2q http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1j4evq/new_version_311_uploaded/cbbbc0p?context=3
  "When signing free agents, if you offer then a contract 2 years longer/shorter than the one they want, they'll counter offer one with 1 more/less year. If you offer the same amount of money you previously offered, and change the year to what they want, they'll automatically offer the lowest $ for that amount of years."
  shouldn't be able to immediately trade away players you just acquired
transaction log
  put index on pids involved, so then events involving a player can be shown on player page
Finals MVP
more detailed player moods - http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1k4val/players_refusing_to_sign_bug/cbln1oo?context=3
more detailed draft - slower picks, trades, etc.
strategy shouldn't be set randomly at start of new league
AI teams need to get smarter about projecting the value of future draft picks: http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1jzel1/very_helpful_hint_regarding_tanking_and_draft/
dashboard info should be on a widget accessible from any screen
some UI indicating how players developed over the offseason
  integrated into roster, or separate page?
player search page
  show stats, ratings, contract, etc. (customizable); allow filters to be applied. also filter by skill icon
finances - too easy to make big $$$
player morale - punishment for tanking
player personality, team chemistry
team colors, and uniforms in player icons
rookies are too good
fire GM before draft?
harsher, more realistic luxury tax
midlevel exception
playerNameLabels should also put a little hover box over the player link with key stats/ratings
more refined control of playing time: http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1j1e6q/i_made_a_singleplayer_basketball_management/cbaegpq
signing draft picks should be optional
  maybe sign them in the "resign players" phase
you should be able to drop below 5 players (and above 15) but only temporarily (no game simulation in that time)
fake feet/inches heights should be taller
some players want to resign for infinite money?
draft
  randomness in picks should factor in relative ratings http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1l1713/the_draft_still_needs_some_work_it_seems_my/cbutw7v?context=1
  there should be some indication about the quality of upcoming drafts, which would influence how players/AI value draft picks
  somehow allow uploading of custom draft classes
more visibly promote subreddit
auto sort roster based on value
"rookie contracts" when a new game is started should be bounded at 5 million. so do bound at 20 million before dividing by 4.
sourcemaps putting blank line in front of each file?
trades between AI teams
  each day, pick two random teams. if a trade can be found that both teams like, do it
    generalize core.trade.makeItWork and other parts of core.trade
  transaction log is necessary to keep tabs on this stuff
  also propose trades to the user, somehow
user can't just sign all the free agents before AI teams
"coaches" should factor in synergy in gameSim substitutions
  also, base it on value, not ovr
IE10 support
  dropdowns disappear on refresh?
    unit tests fail too, seemingly for the same reason
  text in dashboard is messed up
core.team.valueChange should be used to pick which free agents to sign in core.freeAgents.autoSign, but that would be a bitch beacuse of how transactions are set up
  also for resigning players in core.season
revamp core.team.valueChange
  simpler formulas for rebuilding/contending team values
trades
  fancy scrolling of summary box, or some better UI
  refactor core.trade. it's an utter mess.
  cash
    otherCash and userCash containing the amount
    estimate value of cash - different for different teams? depending on cash, net profit recently, and market size
    upper limit? what is NBA rule?
  ask button
    should there be another one to see what the team will give up for a player? like in civ4, and then only have one active at a time?
    be more careful about UI, such as when to make button visible - make it like civ4?
  more feedback from AI
    if trade is close/far from working, return different messages
    display some indication of what a team wants to do on the trade view, e.g.
      "I need to cut my payroll and start making more money."
      "I could really use a good rebounder."
all star game
team and league records (highest scoring game, etc)
switch teams after you're fired
trades
  allow trades to go over the roster limit, but show a warning. also factor into AI logic that they would have to drop a player
    warning should be in a different color than the error-like warnings
    after trade, AI drops player immediately
    don't allow game simulation if player's team is over limit - currently this is only checked at the beginning of the season, right?
  sign and trade (only during resigning phase)
profits too large, too easy
  add corporate tax?
  luxury tax increases for repeat offenders?
only show retired players in season summary if they actually played some
Look at ratings distributions - should there really be so many bigs who are great passers, for instance?
components.dropdown tests are very slow in chrome
export/import roster
  some way to specify startingSeason
  download link performance
    http://mjtemplate.org/examples/rison.html
    something besides a data URI?
    no base64? Firefox can't handle #
  error handling if blank or invalid file is supplied
  easily edit in excel?
http://blog.stevensanderson.com/2013/05/20/knockout-es5-a-plugin-to-simplify-your-syntax/
move most db functions into core.whatever. db should just be about initializing/upgrading
  get rid of "db" module dependence
core.freeAgents should be core.freeAgent or core.freeAgency?
after last resigning negotiation, switch to next phase?
draft lottery
  do a dramatic presentation?
  increase hype for teams that exceed expectations
  tied records?
how to handle aggregating stats for players who played for more than one team in a season? add them all up in ps in db.getPlayers
  for roster, want just a player's stats with this team this season
    this currently works, just pass a tid
  for player stats view, want total among all teams for one season
    no pass tid and you only get the latest row. need added logic to do sum
  for player view, want separate and combined rows in careerStats without fucking up totals (including PER)
    no pass tid and you get each team separately, but no merged stats as above
better default league name
contracts
  maybe make them nonlinear.. role players lower, stars higher
    compare to NBA contract distribution
luxury tax should be disbursed amongst non-taxpaying teams
give bbgm website its own version of bootstrap (only with components needed)
team.rosterAutoSort should automatically set dbChanged, and have an option to not if that's important
test trades more
  multi-player valuation
    rank players by value. each additional value gets some multiplier to diminish its influence. this prevents adding a player to a trade from decreasing its value
    but this should have something to do with the difference between numbers of players on each side?
analytics
  should have no more referrals from basketball-gm.com since it's all set to the same domain now
  https://github.com/segmentio/analytics.js/
    analytics.pageview in lib/davis.google_analytics.js
    analytics.track to get rid of bbgmPing
    how to initialize GA with correct options?
notifications (and log) from top right to display log of key events
  game results from user's team
  players retiring from user's team
  league champions
  trades
  free agent signings
how to deal with a team that drops below 5 active players, factoring in injuries?
  should minimum roster size be higher?
  should allow them to exceed roster limit while injury exists
  should not allow play when below 5
  should use same logic/functions as core.season that checks on new season.
    first, add support for auto-add players when AI teams are below limit (in season.js)
  if fouling out drops team below 5, play fouled out players but add a FT each foul (technical)
check effects of extreme ticket prices
show old contracts on old roster view
force roster reorder handles to stay big even if window is small
reassess ui module. delete stuff like ui.dropdown. move other functions elsewhere?
  what is the difference between util.viewHelpers, views.components, and ui?
can i get rid of js/api.js?
core.trade refactoring
  validateSavedTids crap should be in trade.js.
  trade.summary stuff should be automatic and stored in tradeStore
  trade and clear buttons should be disabled during gameSim, wiht message like in team finances
too easy to do the "be bad, get draft picks, keep payroll low, sign free agents, be good" pattern
  free agents are even less willing to sign with the user, even if it's a good team
final score, hall of fame
  influenced by size of city (see: difficulty in views.newLeague)
any raw data files should go in the data folder, ideally with a script to convert them to however they're used here
database changes
  add activeYears multientry like statsTids use for:
    league leaders
    stats
    ratings
gameSim
  more penalty for really unbalanced rosters: http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1j1e6q/i_made_a_singleplayer_basketball_management/cba743c?context=3
  rename compositeRating to compositeRatings (or something better)
    other plural issues in gameSim
  playing time not adding up to 240?
  do some kind of profiling, see if i can speed it up
    any way to speed up PER? maybe break it up into smaller functions so they can be profiled
    do i need all the player composite ratings?
    do i need all the team composite ratings?
    how does performance change/degrade as the years go on?
  bench players should get minutes in blowouts
in lock functions, update g from database before using any potentially sensitive values
  or should these g.whatever variables be set at all if they're sensitive? lid doesn't change obviously, but the others?
move to new window button, like gmail, that will open a view in a new window with a minimal UI
  only the icon should be clickable, not the area above and below
AI modules that contain functions which are called to determine actions
  things to regulate...
    draft picks
    signing free agents
    resigning players
    trades
    budget items (like from team finances view)
    releasing/buying out players when over limit
player finder
  search by stats or ratings
  trade for button, or sign button if free agent
customize which columns are shown in roster view (and possibly other summary views like trade, free agent, etc)
  http://datatables.net/extras/colvis/
PER
  slow, particularly after multiple seasons?
    can i have it share a transaction with writing stats in core.game?
  how to deal with players traded mid-season?
    reevaluate this in general. stats don't seem to be showing after a trade in roster view and player view.
some UI showing the state of the team's synergy. maybe like an advisors screen that suggests what kind of player is needed to improve synergy
  also can respond to budget changes
more handlebars helpers for things like...
  team dropdown
  season dropdown
go through future list - anything that should be here?
DataTables - fix default sort order on column click
  text should be asc, numeric should be desc (except draft picks)
  http://datatables.net/ref#asSorting will work. maybe pass it as an option to bbgm_datatable
  but can it be set globally, based on column type? can have ui.datatable automatically read columns and figure it out?
more tests
  https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul
  https://github.com/metagriffin/indexeddb-js can i improve this and run tests outside of browser?
like on team finances page, anywhere else to add help popups?
  should this be abstracted rather than just inline in views?
  inline anything from the manual?
tweak gameSim for stats again
freeAgentMoods should affect AI team signings - or should it?
  for resigning players
  for signing free agents
bar graphs
  gradients like http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/components.html#progress
AI updating of *Budgets and ticket prices
  maybe not necessary at this stage?
  call core.finances.updateBudgetRanks() after
team finances template: handlebars helper for form DRY?
update formulas
  nationalTvRevenue
    same for each team, change contract year by year and display in team finances
  localTvRevenue
    eventually, t.seasons[0].tvContract
preview strength of the draft, free agent class

FUTURE
------

double season: http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1kja6e/so_my_league_decided_to_have_an_extended_season/
IE10 support
  davisjs for knockoutjs links in IE10
    elem.host comes up blank in originChecks
    hacky solution used now (see js/lib/README.md) but maybe this will lead to a real answer: http://stackoverflow.com/q/17641380/786644
  http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1kj8nv/i_have_updated_firefox_but_the_game_wont_load_in/
hire/fire different coaches with different strategies
jslint errors
  currently just "Don't make functions within a loop." which should all be fixed eventually
Web workers
  don't seem to actually help performance. maybe help responsiveness
  benchmark?
  would it be worth it to parallelize advstats?
boxplots for shot location stats, plus comparison to NBA data
import/export stuff
  online "locker" that you can sync saved games to
  https://unhosted.org/adventures/7/Adding-remote-storage-to-unhosted-web-apps.html
  data urls don't work with more than ~1 MB. downloadifydoesn't seem to work with more than several MBs of data. until a better solution comes (online sync?), wait.
  league names
    "Edit" button between "Export" and "Delete" - set in leaguesStore and gameAttributes
      move delete/edit/export under one button, "manage". have the 3 buttons pop out in place when you hit manage, then it functions as it does now. popped buttons can be colored too, then
  import league
    ignore old lid
other advanced stats
  WS - http://www.basketball-reference.com/about/ws.html requires Basketball on Paper - http://www.sports-reference.com/cbb/about/ws.html is simpler
  +/- and other stats needed to calculate above - track in game
  APM?
hitting the phase twice shouldn't be possible. but if i, for instance, hit "until preseason" twice quickly, i skip a year
  maybe have something like lock.phaseChangeInProgress? but some timeout would be needed to reset
worth it to switch to closure library? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10782612/what-is-the-sturdiest-way-to-get-the-closure-compilers-type-safety-together-wit
roster size check on new season
  cpu teams with < 5 players should automatically sign free agents
moving to other cities
expansion teams (add population growth, expand when certain conditions are met)
team finances view
  compare bar graphs against league averages?
different size stadiums, building new stadiums
tv revenue as a variable
  local tv contract - $10 million
    base on tvContractAmount, tvContractExp
    will be a deal from 3 to 5 years in length
    based on...
      region population
      "hype"
      random noise
      "random event" - competition between two networks, Sports TV and The Basketball Channel
    when renegotiating and really bad, the guy pretends not to know you - "Atlanta Herons? Is that the team from the Mexican/Canadian/Arena/Indoor/Xtreme Volleyball/Soccer/Tennis/Racing/Curling/MudWrestling League?"
stat views
  add team dropdown to ratings and stats views - but should this refresh the view, or just filter the DataTable?
    could use something like http://www.datatables.net/extras/thirdparty/ColumnFilterWidgets/DataTables/extras/ColumnFilterWidgets/ to also filter on positions
  playoff/regular season toggle in team/player stats, league leaders
  player stats: toggle to only show players > 2000 minutes http://www.nba.com/leader_requirements.html
  per 36 stats in team/player stats view, league leaders
    add a dropdown (maybe make the dropdown handling code more general?)
bootstrap 2.3
https://github.com/nprapps/app-template
race conditions associated with callbacks when passing around transactions
  any put/add/update does not guarantee it's finished until the transaction finishes. but letting transactions finish is slow.
contract negotiation
  don't have counter-offers be too drastic
  weirdness http://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/1j1e6q/i_made_a_singleplayer_basketball_management/cbabaq1 http://www.reddit.com/r/BasketballGM/comments/1j3it8/free_agency_bug/
  add free agent to the end of roster
eliminate jquery UI dependency? it's only used for roster reordering currently
real calendar
  player.injury.gamesRemaining
core.gameSim.updateSynergy should produce continuous output
  no big difference between a 80 rating and 79 rating, or whatever
input to helpers.formatCurrency (and all currency in variables everywhere) should be in 1000s of dollars and then only converted to millions when displayed
AI teams should have to deal with fuzz too
if play menu is open when it refreshes, automatically open it again after refresh
  not so easy.. tried it in 34927959b2b0acd08224665654343d97ffaea281 but there were issues with updatePlayMenu being called multiple times, for instance at the end of the season
"dbChanged" updateEvent - more correct way
  store a list of times and "update events". compare last updated time against that list, and then see the update events. pass as list in "update event" to realtime update
  check everywhere dbChange or lastDbChange is set and see if it should be more refined
    add playerMovement updateEvent, for when a player signs a contract, becomes a free agent, or is traded
bbgmView
  can i do some check to abandon display if idLoading is mismatched with reality? like for clicking a slow link followed by a fast link, in rapid succession, the fast output should show and the slow should be short circuited.
    in practice, this doesn't seem to matter much
  shouldn't have newPhase updateEvent doing much. instead, have an array of what changed in that phase
    (updateEvents.indexOf("newPhase") >= 0 && g.phase === g.PHASE.PRESEASON) should be newSeason
  use req.redirect from POST to manage history optimally
  make it less tied to BBGM specifically. shouldn't depend on BBGM-specific modules like g, ui, and util/viewHelpers
player development should depend on playing time
http://code.google.com/p/htmlcompressor/ or something similar
core.player.ovr shouldn't just average ratings together. some ratings are more important than others. do regression analysis against PER to prove this and find a better formula.
player.filter
  the special case attributes should generally be moved directly into the database?
views.teamFinances should merge db call with team.filter to get seasonAttrs, but that will require rewriting seasonAttrs handling in team.filter to handle multiple seasons.

Template Stuff
--------------

Below are relatively boring/minor improvements that would make the templating slightly better/faster/clearer/whatever.

gameLog
  boxScore should be observable, but nothing inside should be except gid
dashboard
  observables set right by mapping
    historical things (old scores, old records) don't need to be observable?
    arrays need correct keys
team finances
  smarter updating of player salaries table: contracts should only update on playerMovement
feasible to use knockout for updating datatable? or kogrid?
trade - not fully knockoutifieid
  mapping to update summary.teams.trade, userRoster, otherRoster
  can i do a redirect from post without refreshing everything?
    just call ui.realtimeUpdate which should allow for smart handling
      if trade is accepted/cleared, playerMovement will instigate a refresh of rosters
      if trade is proposed, message will somehow explicity be sent (set in VM? but what if VM not initialized?)
  when to delete stored message?
    at beginning of new propose
    on clear
    when team changes
  changing the trading partner shouldn't refresh the user's team
negotiation
  some things can probably be non-observable
draftSummary
  don't show this season as option if before draft - have an option in components.dropdown
playerNameLabels always updates even if none of the inputs did - why
  if ratings.skills is generated by the mapping plugin, it's an observable array and this fucks things up. it would be a bitch to fix, though.
    quick fix - return a string for templates rather than array.
leaders
  flatten a bit
roster
  check release, buy out, trade for
  flatten a bit
  vars.ptModifiers does not need to be observable
dataTables/grid knockout
  examples
    https://github.com/CogShift/Knockout.Extensions
      https://github.com/CogShift/Knockout.Extensions/issues/9
    https://github.com/Knockout-Contrib/KoGrid
    http://chadmullins.com/javascript/knockout-js-series-part-2-binding-knockout-js-to-a-datatables-grid/
inbox
  on new message (can be a newMessage update event), just add to messages list rather than always refreshing
player_
  face display with forward/back button?
    some things become observables - why???
    mapping function not run right the second time - try to create jsfiddle
      arrays are becoming observableArrays
schedule, teamHistory
  partial load of list for updates, like in gameLog list
freeagents
  optimize refreshes
dist
  allow updating box plots without refresh
gameLog
  set more stuff through mapping
reassess dropdown - should it really be called like it is in uiEvery? can i use a computed? problem is, some things need to listen to updateEvents too, not just observables

# Pre-JavaScript TODO

player view
  next, previous buttons (also active on left/right arrows)

roster
  highlight handle on hover, like button
  "trade for" only sensitive when trades are allowed

Client-side game simulation
  Robustness of javascript code
    g.phase == 3 in league_views might introduce race condition
    validate data from client?
    make sure play menu doesn't ever get stuck - some kind of timeout

play button requirements
  colors - is this a good idea?
    green: move to new phase
    blue: play games
    red: other immediate action

make validate_season work correctly

include sidebar(s) showing all relevant information, plus make that stuff generated by a separate function so it can eventually be kept static as JS updates other content

grep for # links: grep -R --include="*.html" '<a href="#">' .

# Then

self-contained game simulation code, to allow other people to hack on it easily. automatically make charts and stuff.

warning when window is closed and game simulation is in progress

# BELOW IS OLD STUFF

Minor bugs:

Don't allow sort from first column of trade window

UI
--
in team stats tab, allow toggle to show opponent stats

NBA
---
real salary cap rules: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_Salary_Cap
real contract rules (max/min, etc.)
allow contracts that aren't the same $ every year
team and player options
releasing players - see the salary cap wiki page for complicated rule
trading deadline

AI (NON-GAMESIM)
----------------
trade
  AI teams trade with each other
  Feedback from trades (way off, that's close, etc)
  "Oh, you again?" after failed trade attempts
  AI teams should be aware of contract lengths and the implications thereof
AI teams release/buy out players to sign a better free agent

FEATURES
--------
multi-team trades... how can i make a good UI for that?
