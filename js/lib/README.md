These are various third-party libraries used in Basketball GM. They are all
standard, except jQuery UI is a custom download including only "sortable"
support as the rest isn't used.

I'm using bootstrap-dropdown.js 2.0.2 because 2.1.0+ interferes with Davis.js
handling normal links in the play menu. See
