				<h3>New to {GAME_NAME}?</h3>
				<p>
					Have you ever looked at the decisions made by the front office of an{" "}
					{pro} team and thought you could do better? Well, now you can! In{" "}
					{GAME_NAME}, you are the general manager of a {process.env.SPORT}{" "}

						<h3>You Set The Strategy</h3>
						<p>
							Running a {process.env.SPORT} team requires you to make tough
							decisions.
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Should you re-sign a veteran player, or leave cap space open to
								sign a free agent?
							</li>
							<li>
								Should you draft a raw player who could be a star, or someone
								who can contribute right away?
							</li>
							<li>
								Should you trade away next season's draft pick for a player who
								can help you win now, or stockpile assets for the future?
							</li>
							<li>
								Should you raise ticket prices and annoy your fans, or can you
								cut part of your budget instead?
							</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							Make the right choices and you can build a dynasty. But make the
							wrong choices and you'll get fired!
						</p>

					<div className="col-sm-6 col-md-12 col-lg-6">
						<h3>High Quality, No Junk</h3>
						<p>
							{GAME_NAME} is completely 100% free. You can start as many leagues
							as you want and play as many seasons as you want. No limits.
						</p>
						<p>
							We won't ask for your email address and send you spam. We won't
							force you to sign in with your Facebook account and spam your
							friends. We won't ask you to pay money to keep playing or to buy
							game-breaking power-ups.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our only goal is making the best possible {process.env.SPORT}{" "}
							management game!

				<h3>Expecting to find a league here?</h3>
				<p>
					{GAME_NAME} stores all game data on your computer, in your browser
					profile. This means that you can't play one league on multiple devices
					unless you export it (from the Tools menu) and then create a new
					league with that file. So first,{" "}
					<b>make sure you're using the same browser on the same computer</b>.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you are using the same browser on the same computer and your
					leagues are missing, the game data has probably been deleted. This can
					happen in places like schools and libraries that set browsers to
					automatically delete everything when they are closed. It also happens
					if you manually delete your browser data. For example, in Chrome, if
					you go to More tools &gt; Clear browsing data... &gt; Cookies and
					other site and plugin data, that will delete all your
					{GAME_NAME} data.{" "}
					<a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=340821">
						This is true even if you tell it to only delete data from today - if
						you played {GAME_NAME} at all today, it will completely delete all
						your leagues.
					</a>{" "}
					Browsers may also delete data if disk space is running low, but I'm
					not sure if that ever actually happens.
				</p>
				<p>
					In cases where the data has been deleted from your browser profile,
					the only way to get it back is if you have a backup. Sorry :(
