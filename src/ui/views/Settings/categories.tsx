					is a new way to play the end of basketball games. In the final period
					of the game, when the clock goes below a certain point ("Minutes Left
					Trigger"), the clock is turned off. The winner of the game will be the
					team that first hits a target score. That target is determined by
					adding some number of points ("Target Points to Add") to the leader's
					current score.
				</p>
				<p>
					By default, the trigger is 4 minutes remaining and the target points
					to add is 8.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Elam Ending generally makes the end of the game more exciting.
					Nobody is trying to run out the clock. Nobody is trying to foul or
					call strategic timeouts or rush shots. It's just high quality
					basketball, every play until the end of the game.
