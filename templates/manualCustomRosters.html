<p>Basketball GM supports custom roster files that define the players to be used in a new league.</p>

<h2>Getting a Custom Roster File</h2>

<p>There are two sources of roster files:</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Download:</b> If someone has made a custom roster file and put it up online, you can download it and use it. However, since this feature is new, probably nobody has done this yet.</li>
  <li><b>Export:</b> From within any league, you can export the rosters from any season (current or past) by clicking "Export Rosters" at the bottom of the league menu on the left.</li>
</ol>

<p>It is also easy to edit these roster files however you want, as is described below.</p>

<h2>Using a custom roster file</h2>

<p>When you are creating a <a href="/new_league">new league</a>, change the rosters from "Random Players" to "Upload Custom Rosters". Then, select your desired roster file.</p>

<h2>Editing a Custom Roster File</h2>

<p>A custom roster file is simply a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a> file containing a list of players. You can add/remove/edit any part of it.</p>

<p>The easiest way to do this would probably be to look at the structure of an exported roster file and base your new file off that. Since the exported files are compressed into a single line of text, you should first run it through <a href="http://jsonprettyprint.com/">a JSON prettifier like this</a>.</p>

<p>Many fields in the exported roster files are optional if you're making your own rosters. The only required ones are shown below. Any other fields you see in an exported or custom roster file are purely optional.</p>

<p>A list of things you should know when making a roster file:</p>

<ul>
  <li>tid is the team ID number, ranging from 0 to 29 in alphabetical order. -1 is for free agents.</p>
  <li>In the example above, there are only two players defined. If your file doesn't include at least 5 players on every team, then bad things will happen when you try to use it.</li>
  <li>You can view definitions of all the rating abbreviations within any league by going to the player ratings page and hovering your mouse over each column header.</li>
  <li>Ratings should be on a scale from 0 to 100 with a mean of about 50 and about half of the players between 35 and 65. Descriptions of rating categories:
    <ul>
      <li>"hgt": height, which factors into pretty much everything - this is meant to also reflect things like standing reach and wingspan, and it is used in game simulations rather than the player's "true" height in feet/inches</li>
      <li>"stre": strength, which influences defense, rebounding, and low post scoring</li>
      <li>"spd": speed, which influences ball handling, fast breaking, and defense</li>
      <li>"jmp": jumping, which influences finishing at the rim, rebounding, blocking shots, and defense</li>
      <li>"endu": endurance, which governs how fast a player's skills degrade as he gets tired</li>
      <li>"ins": low post scoring</li>
      <li>"dnk": dunking/layups</li>
      <li>"ft": free throw shooting</li>
      <li>"fg": 2 point jump shot ability</li>
      <li>"tp": 3 point shooting</li>
      <li>"blk": shot blocking (also influences overall defense by making the offensive players more wary of attacking)</li>
      <li>"stl": stealing (also influences overall defense by making the offensive players more wary of attacking)</li>
      <li>"drb": dribbling (also influences passing, since you can pass easier if you're not worried about losing the ball)</li>
      <li>"pss": passing</li>
      <li>"reb": rebounding</li>
      <li>"pot": estimate of the player's potential future overall rating</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You can optionally include a URL for an image to be used instead of a randomly-generated face by putting "imgURL": "http://www.example.com/img.jpg" in the root of a player object.</li>
</ul>
